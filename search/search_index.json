Suspected trapper William.</p> <p>William and Red Cap are friends. Chad killed William. We killed Red Cap, and took Chad back to town.</p> Session 1.2 <p>Chadwick never collected his cart. \u201cEmerald Spears\u201d adventurer crew arrived. Looking for henchmen and guides. Came in the night before, buying up all the spirits and ale. Have map to an old ruin.  Hugh, barkeep.</p> <p>Rikoris, leader of Emerald Spears. Sent to collect family heirlooms from a distant noble family in Brayvoy. Passed empty farms on the way into town. Emerald Spears attempted to loot farms near a small hamlet.</p> <p>We take the cart back to Chadwick\u2019s farm. Rapid packed and left, including furniture, firewood, and sheep. Even all of the compost was collected from the barn. All the collected seed is removed. Evidence that Chadwick repaired the farm after we left, but didn\u2019t go collect Chad or the cart.</p> <p>We came back toward town and went to the Mitchell sheep farm. Wife heard about some issues, like a nearby farm took in a refugee girl from a farm that was attacked by goblins. They heat us up for dinner. </p> <p>We tracked the goblins back to their cave and cleared it out. The rabid boss knocked Voldun and Gaea unconscious, but not before Gaea could stabilize Voldun.</p> <p>Level Up: New Spell Comprehend Languages Eldritch Invocations: Mask of Many Faces Fiendish Vigor</p> <p>My Dao, during my unconsciousness, has instructed me on both appearing more strong and on surviving more damage. Thanks to their influence I shall be bigger and stronger. They were satisfied that I continued to protect my smaller friends. I have been rewarded for that bravery by learning to read or listen to any communication. Most amazing is that I can use my ring to bolster the limited healing gifts from Nesirie.</p> Session 1.3 <p>Woke up the next morning on Mitchell's front porch. Gaea healed up with warlock pact slots. Return to town.  Wilfiz books the carnival for two weeks. 20s</p> <p>Gaea bought a barrel of soft cider and stored it away in the Genie Vessel. Once inside, I met the Dao again face to face. He has black obsidian skin, 12 ft tall, and welcomed me to use his space.</p> <p>Dile of the Thieves Guild; has a pet Crocodile.</p> <p>Thistlebloom carried a chest down into the tavern. Voldune escorted Hugh out and locked the door. Olympia unlocked the chest, but Wilfiz heard a creature in the box. Thistlebloom didn\u2019t open the box, and started to walk upstairs to investigate with Detect Magic, leaving an unlocked box on the table across from where Gaea was standing. He opened the chest with Thaumaturgy, which fell open and released a White Serpent. Voldun cleared the room with Thunderwave, before destroying all that furniture with Shatter. Wilfiz cast Grease and used the flamethrower of his cannon to ignite it. The snake died, and Gaea began cleaning up the tavern. The party looted the three rooms rented by the Emerald Spears. </p> Session 1.4 <p>Bruk was warned about our combat by village guards and he came out to personally investigate. </p> <p>Fortune Teller informs us we will travel overnight to find and save all of our townspeople. The heterochromia eyed fishmonger will tell us where to find time.</p> <p>We go to the bar down by the wharf. </p> <p>Rikoras\u2019s Journal: 8<sup>th</sup> son of a baron of The City. Started Emerald Spears. Found Emerald Spear in a Dungeon, it is sentient. Guildford Trading Company hired the ES, a shady patron, hired to collect stuff from old estate in the Ruins. Collect three chests, secured with magic. Notes of oddities: empty hamlet. </p> <p>Gaea memorizes one of the villagers that was fired.</p> Session 1.5 <p>Fish Monger\u2019s gang laid out Joey\u2019s gang. Went well, didn\u2019t spill out into the rest of the village. Joey\u2019s faction is angry with Bruk and us.</p> <p>Sorcerous family from City of Sigil(?): knows about portals. Explains Teleport, Teleportation Circle, Gate, doors, Well of Many Worlds, Cubic Gate. </p> <p>Day 4 of carnival, Heather\u2019s family was found murdered, she is missing. Didn\u2019t show up at the carnival like was expected on the first night. The murder was two days ago. Friends are three minor thugs, Joey\u2019s turf. Human, 5\u20194\u201d, brown hair, blue/green eyes. (Dead grandma\u2019s house)</p> <p>Gaea commits floating dead body to memory, is currently a very poor imitation of Heather\u2019s boyfriend. Tattoo of crow on dead bodies, Joey\u2019s mark, on various locations. He is carrying a greatsword disguised as a dagger.</p> <p>Heather is talking through the door. She is worried about the Moon eye dwarfs, they have silver eyes. This was hinted at by the Fortune Teller. Heather opens the door and reveals her small self with blue/green eyes. Mooneyes exit the house of mirrors when people go in.  We\u2019re returning to the carnival, Gaea is disguised in his clerical vestments.</p> Session 1.6 <p>We bust in on the fortune teller to see if she\u2019s in on it. </p> <p>Enter the house of mirrors. Mirror Demon attacks, we kill it, it had been haunting the mirrors.</p> Session 1.7 <p>Glass land: Soldiers with great swords, pikes, archers, Red Wizards (offense), Blue Wizards(Defensive), Warlock (Great Old One, He Whole Walks Behind) troops. Barracks to the right, with armories and blacksmiths. Miner housing, made of mirrors, holding families. Basic farming plots. Fairly old, up to 30 years. Ambient glow, no primary life source. Octagonal center, 2000 feet high glass ceiling. Outer wall looks into the House of Mirrors. Each wall of the octagon has a similar platform. North-most sheet has a metal wall and aperture gate shielding.</p> <p>Enslaved peasants - about triple our village. Troops - about 2000, mustering for war. Larval Doppolgangers</p> <p>Gaea escapes his cell to hang out with the Dao, who freed me from my bounds. I brought some items back to the jail and attempted to free Wilfiz with a maul. I tried three times, the first bounced off of the shackles, and the next two times I hit the tiny gnome in the head. I did heal him though.</p> <p>Momom greets us from a neighboring cell. We killed two guards.</p> Session 1.8 <p>We arrive in the rebel stronghold. Momom is not well greeted. Scarda has been building this place for 40 years. Another mirror opened to someplace bad, home to eldritch horrors. Scarda has built a protective aperture gate. This is where the Doppelgangers come from. The mirror demon just kind of haunts the mirror, like Scarda had told us in the House of Mirrors. Momom is a leader of the Doppelgangers, the old ones have the gained personality. Plenty of younger Doppelgangers still function with Scarda and will try to murder Momom\u2019s people. Changlings are born in the mirror world of people and Dopps.  Chadwick, leading our villagers Momom, leader of free Dopps Kilgrave, leader of the peasants that have been here the whole time. From the Duke\u2019s kingdom.  Hohime, family of mercs who want out of here. Has contacts among the active duty roles. Serra, the angry dwarf lady who wants us to kill Scarda and the guards. Leader of the past rebellion. Represents the clerics. Lieutenants and commanders of rebel troops. Fathom, represents those who worship The Beyond. Connected to the Black Robes, 800. </p> <p>Gaea met and chummed with Serra\u2019s clerics. </p> Season 1 Finale <p>5 Mass Cure Wounds 5 Healing Word +2 Plate</p> <p>Gaea is wearing the glass +2 plate, disguise self into 7ft Krogan, and gets right up in his face Bruk ran up, hits him, and pulls back Oylmipia misses with crossbow Wilfiz pushed him back away from me with the cannon, then casts Grease on Krogan, who is no longer in melee with Gaea Gaea has 29 mirror images. 26 image</p>"},{"location":"session_notes/#season-2","title":"Season 2","text":"Session 2.0 <p>New: Druid Sorcerer Bard</p> <p>Running from S's forces. People butchered, Duke assassination. Our descriptions were sent out as the assassin's. The Duke's people seem to be replaced by doppelgangers.

Weird about stolen lands: At least 3 kingdoms used to exist and have left a currency. Weird, black market entities (four armed slender men) which only trade in the old coin: Cyclops, Lizardman, Elf. Elves captured spirits for magic power, eventually larger spirits were included until doing so released hostile entities that the spirits had been holding back.</p> <p>Ambient magic power from monoliths. Gemstones can collect Fey energy if properly crafted.</p> <p>Fall (after Equinox) has extreme weather. Hex sides are 21 miles</p> <p>A clan of Merrow raised out of a river and our casters blasted most of them with lightning. After a battle, we restrained one and Jangles used Geas to assign it to pull the Deathwagon for 30 days. Gaea healed it back to half health. </p> <p>We pull up to a wooden fort in the hills. Nici tells us it is Fort Racharo, an abandoned fort of Brevoy. About 3 days out </p> Session 2.2 <p>The party awakes to find the merrow dead, Gaea killed it on watch to release it from servitude. The river leads us to a waterfall and we discussed leaving the river by the road, but end up putting the wagon into the mirror and Gaea Fly\u2019s down the cliff. Bruk and Voldun go over the waterfall in a barrel. Nici and the centaur sorcerer take the long way around and find an empty fort. </p> <p>We hear a scream and see a woman stuck with an arrow, with a bandit in tow. We kill the bandits and save an additional woman. The Bandits have silver pendants, wolf skulls with deer antlers. </p> <p>The two horses had Zephyr Horseshoes which we put onto our horses. The two women joined the village. We continue down the river.</p> Session 2.3 <p>A T-Rex bursts out into the river and threatens us. Voldun casts a sleet storm, Bruk turned into a snake to approach it, but it bit him back to dwarf form and he washed down river. Jangle stood on a stalactite arrow and Gaea shot him to the beast. The monstrous, cursed goblin crawled around and abused the T-Rex, which caused it to change into a gigantic toad which bounded off and away.</p> <p>We rode down the river to the Ruins of the ancient Elven civilization. We see the tracks of a giant bipedal bovine. Spirit orbs create a nexus or computer network, the painted runes are acting like a virus attacking that.</p> Session 2.4 <p>Lake around the Elven (Pagnacost) ruins. There are mirrors that redirect light into the canyon.  Two Hezrow demons are mid-incantation when we disrupt them. Yakphok (The Minotaurs) bound the Acayo Demons. One nearly struck down Gaea, then a poorly cast Sleep spell from the sorcerer knocked him out. Zniavolieny stepped from the ring to save Gaea from the bound demons and also offered to bring in the party, which they accepted. They have shared knowledge with the party. Obelisks 12 Yakphok, Take over Ziggeret to Take over Elven Ruins. </p> <p>Sorcerer jumps out of the ring, polymorphed into a bird, and flew us to the Ziggurat. All are out of the ring, after a long rest, with 30 minutes of Pass Without Trace. +1 STR/CON, +1 AC, taller</p> Session 2.5 <p>We entered a broken door around the middle of the Ziggurat and headed down in. About 5 floors down we emerge onto a 100\u2019 square room with a large wolf-ish spirit. A raven flies over and lands on the wolf. A nine tailed fox sneaks up behind and giggles before joining the wolf - Fenris.</p> <p>Elf magic has nearly drained the will out of the wolf. Its strength has been drained to power the magic. (Big brother - raven - Hugo, Little sister - fox - Kit)  New power, Gnosis, for Necci, Voldun, Miravish, Bruk d6 when making an associated skill check, able to manifest as spirit or </p> <p>The spirits fade away. We head up to the top in search of what the draining of the spirits might have left behind.  When she was alone, Olympia met the demon lord and gained a boon.</p> <p>We slaughtered a Blood Demon. +2 Levels!</p> Session 2.6 <p>Necci\u2019s dream of the elven city.</p> <p>We killed a Demon</p> Session 2.7 <p>We settle in for a week of downtime before clearing the city. Necci continues her research. Gaea feeds the kingdom in the mornings and spends the afternoons using Cartographers Tools to translate the Raven powered scouts\u2019 reports into an up-to-date, prepared battle map.</p> <p>Hugh lets us know where Elven wine could be found. We found two Blood demons, and kill them. The sorcerer Lightning Bolts Gaea to kill the last demon. 30+ damage and Gaea loses his Hex. He is not happy, and spends the time where everyone else is investigating the alcohol resting.</p> <p>Hugh has a rune flash on his forehead as he shakes Necci\u2019s hand. She vanishes and he causes three Dao to step into the basement. The sorcerer seizes the possessed Hugh in Telekinesis, but a wild magic surge makes a Displacer Beast materialize. Voldune moves in to fight, Gaea flys down into the basement with Genie flight, and invokes Dark Obelisk.</p> <p>We free Hugh, and the three Dao begin to walk away through portals. Everyone dashes in immediately, except Olympia and Gaea. Gaea is tending to Hugh and Olympia hesitates before rushing after. As she passes him, Gaea punches his ring wearing hand into her goo body and warps down into the ring.</p> <p>Enter narration where the Genie reveals himself to be Gaea as the full powered Dao. He had reached out to Necci back when the Elven city was turning on the Nexus. Her three wishes were two partially disable the Nexus, knowing that Necci in the future could fix it, to wipe her memory of this to prevent the Yaks from extracting it, and to remove her to safety where she could live in the future. Gaea then moved the ring, and his imprisonment, to the coastal cave where his younger self would find it while living as a young Genasi.</p> <p>Level 20 Dao Gaea Notes: 352 HP + 25 HP Armor of Agathys Summon Greater Demon - CR 6 - Echo of Demogorgon Strike of the Giants (Hill Strike) - +1d6 damage on attack, STR DC 24 or prone Limited Wish - 6<sup>th</sup> level or lower and has a casting time of 1 action Minions of Chaos - Conjure Elemental, CR 5 (Xorn or Murder Comet) Devil\u2019s Sight - see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 ft.

Pixies age very slowly, if at all. They are created fully formed, physically and mentally, taking on the appearance of a beautiful human of the age of 10 to 30 with pointed ears. Alignment. Pixies are as wild like the elements of nature they were created from, but also know that nature has rules that it follows. As such the fey are often neutral on the lawful-chaos spectrum, tho some do go to the ends of it sometimes. Protecting nature and its freedom is of utmost importance to pixies, much like other fey, and they are more often good than not. Size. In Pixie form pixie sizes ranging from 3 to 5 inches in sprite form. In giant form they are 12 times this size, going from 3 to 5 inches to 3 to 5 feet tall. Your size is tiny as a Pixies and medium as a giant. Speed. Your base walking speed is 15 feet, and your base flying speed is 40 feet in pixie form, 30 feet walking and 25 flying in giant form. Transformation. pixies have the ability to change between their sprite and giant forms at will, with use of an action. Both forms have their pros and cons however Pixie form is the most well known form. Pixies have the ability to fly and are able to dash through the air the same as when walking in giant form. This ability makes pixies extremely mobile, but it has its cons as well. When in Pixie form, pixies are unable to use any attacks, or spells due to their small size. Flying vertically counts as difficult terrain. In giant form pixies are able to use their normal attacks and spells as any other humanoid can, and gain a faster walking speed. Fey Creature. You are immune to being charmed, and can't be put to sleep by magic. You have 60 ft Darkvision and 60 ft Truesight Languages. You can speak, read, and write common and sylvan. Sylvan is an old language, being the root of elvish. The language is most commonly known for being used in spell incantations, and it is said that one can become entranced by its beauty and fluidity.</p> <p>Ignan Those created from flames have explosively unstable personalities. They are often times the most problematic, due to their short fuses, but Ignan are highly valuable allies. What these flaming Pixies lack in predictability, they make up for in their ability to channel magical forces, making them powerful sorcerers. Ignan elemental colors are vibrant oranges and reds. Their shimmering hair is short and forms into whispy shimmering locks, causing it to resemble actual fire. Their wings resemble autumn leaves, and have even length to width proportions. Ability Score Increase. Your charisma score is increased by 2 and your intelligence score is increased by 1 Burning Spirit. You are resistant to fire damage. Pyromancy. You know the Firebolt cantrip, charisma is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</p> <p>Exile Sometimes seen as a fate worse than death, exile has  long been a popular sanction for radicals, dissidents,  and troublemakers. Exiling these people allows the  authorities to remove a thorn from their sides without  creating a martyr or having to keep the unwanted person  in costly perpetual captivity. Many a coup or revolution  has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime  being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or  neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the  \u2018verse.  On occasion, a person may choose exile voluntarily,  either as an alternative to something worse or because  they desire time on the Frontier to grow and develop. An  exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures  and contact \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities while rallying support  remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that  aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue  otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of  more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the  impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.  Exiles take to adventuring for a number of reasons.  For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they  seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while  others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to  be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some  exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world  with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all,  however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere,  with no choice other than to continue wandering forever. Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival Languages: Any two of your choice Equipment: A dagger, a small strongbox, a memento  from your homeland, a set of common clothes, and a  pouch containing 5 gp Feature: Exile Network You keep in touch with a network of exiles and  expatriates, who possess an eclectic mix of skills and the  durable spirit of pioneers. If you need to find someone  with an unusual or specialized skill (such as art forgery,  translation of ancient languages, or poison-brewing), you  likely know where to find them. Variant Feature: Radical Sympathizers As a prominent figurehead for a group of religious,  political, or ethnic radicals, you are often able to find  people who sympathize with your situation. When you  employ hirelings, they may offer you better rates, fanatical  loyalty, or enhanced services. Reason for Exile You were exiled for a reason. Choose a \u2018crime\u2019 or roll on  the table below to determine why you were forced to leave  your home. d10 Crime 1 Opposition to political rulers 2 Tax exile 3 Religious dissent/radicalism 4 Sentenced to exile for serious crime 5 Death sentence commuted to exile after  committing capital crime 6 Forbidden love 7 Refugee displaced by war or disaster 8 Escaping shameful failures committed at home 9 Fleeing false accusations 10 Self-imposed exile/journey of self-discovery Suggested Characteristics  Being exiled is a deeply painful experience, and life as  a stateless persona non grata is extremely challenging.  Such a trial is sure to leave some marks on the exile\u2019s  personality. d8 Personality Trait 1 I jump whenever anyone knocks on my door. 2 I stand by my principles, rather than compromising  them. 3 Hand-written letters are my preferred means of  communication. 4 I am fascinated by different cultures. 5 I sometimes become pensive and withdrawn. 6 I have a lot of interesting and unusual friends. 7 I often reminisce about my years before exile. 8 I write a lot of poetry in my spare time. d6 Ideal 1 Homecoming.
