# Gadgeteer

A gnome tinkers at his workbench, fervently toiling with two precise instruments under a magnifying lens. Suddenly, a spark of blue electricity flashes across the room and scorches the far wall. The gnome grins and puts away his tools.

An amoeboid carefully positions a rabbit on a pedestal, stands back, and presses a large red button. With a pop and a puff of fur, the rabbit vanishes, only to hop back into the room seconds later, hairless from the waist down. The amoeboid nods and scratches down a few notes.

A bald human woman with a glowing, red, robotic eye tightens the joints on her new cybernetic arm. Her work complete, she rears back her metal fist and crushes a nearby chair.

Gadgeteers are masters of technology and engineering, turning every device available to their advantage. Assisted by their artificial intelligence companions, gadgeteers pursue the cutting edge of science and innovation, acquiring a mass of gadgets and a wealth of knowledge along the way.

## Cutting-Edge Innovators

Impelled by the lure of systems and logic, a wildly eccentric group embraces the sciences. These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly well-educated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.

Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.

## AIs

A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.

But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.

## Creating a Gadgeteer

When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Didyou have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?

Also, consider which Prototype you’ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character’s personality in general.

Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What’s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?

## Quick Build

Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher’s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.

## Class Features

As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:

### Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d6 per gadgeteer level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st

### Proficiencies

Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons

Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist’s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith’s tools, tinker tools

Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence

Skills: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- A repeater and any simple weapon
- (a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters
- (a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist’s tools
- An engineer’s pack and leather armor

### AI Companion

Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence. When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.

Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.

Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.

### Gadgets

At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.

You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.

Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.

Saving Throws. If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:

Gadget save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Overcharge

With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.

This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster’s damage roll.

### Prototype

At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.

#### Experimental Frame

You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:
- Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.
- Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.
- Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.
- Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.
- You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can’t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.
- When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.
- Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.

#### Mechanized Autonomous Construct

You have put the finishing touches on a Mechanized Autonomous Construct (a MAC), which is a specially-constructed automaton piloted by your AI.

The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.

If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your
construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.

You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can’t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.

Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.

##### Mechanized Autonomous Construct

Medium construct, neutral

Armor Class 10 + its creator’s Intelligence modifier

Hit Points 24 (10 + 7 × its creator’s gadgeteer level)

Speed 30 ft.

STR 14 (+2) DEX 14 (+2) CON 14 (+2) INT 14 (+2) WIS 10 (+0) CHA 8 (−1)

Condition Immunities charmed, frightened, poisoned

Languages Common, one language of its creator’s choice

Challenge —

Constructed Nature. The construct doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Combat Protocols. When it rolls initiative, the construct adopts one of two different modes of operation, Offensive or Defensive, which influences the actions it can take in combat. Offensive Mode. While in this mode, attacks against the construct have advantage. The construct can take the Attack (melee weapon attacks only), Dash, Ready, and Use an Object actions on its turn.

Defensive Mode. While in this mode, melee attacks against the construct's creator have disadvantage while the attacker is within the construct's reach. The construct can take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, and Use an Object actions on its turn.

Actions

Integrated Mace. Melee Weapon Attack: its creator’s Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Impulse Leap. The construct launches itself up to 30 feet in any direction, without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Utility Matrix

You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cube-shaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:

##### Cloaking Device. 

As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Flashbang. 

As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Forcefield Projector. 

As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Grappling Hook. 

As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Modular Gadget. 

Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Tech Specialty

Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Bluescreen Protocol

Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Override Protocol

At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Antimagic Pulse

By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes: - The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.
- Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can’t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can’t penetrate into it. - Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.
Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.

## Tech Specialties

Gadgeteers tend to be well-read on a variety of subjects, from data structures and artificial intelligence to blaster mechanics and engineering, but typically put their finest efforts into a pet project of some sort. While working on other tasks, the details of their pet project are running in the background of their minds, slowly being solved and pieced together, while other work busies their hands. 
With enough experience, the subjects of a gadgeteer’s hobby become their tech specialty, a topic in which they are as expert as they are captivated. Often, this specialty is coupled with an objective, a goal to be engineered. Gadgeteers will travel great distances to share research on their mutual specialties, exchanging breakthroughs and discoveries in an effort to achieve a common goal.

### Drone Jockey

Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they’re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones’ sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.

#### Hivemaster

Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once. 

Your drones are improved in the following ways:

- You can add your level to the HP of your drones.
- When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
- When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points. - Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.

You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).

Your drone controller can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.

#### Sacrificial Dive

At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.

#### Focus Fire

Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.

#### Omega Drone

At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone’s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14. 
The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.

Your drone controller can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.

### Futurist

As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.

#### Advanced Subroutines

Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.

##### Genetic Algorithm.

When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.

##### Heatmap. 

When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.

##### Neural Network. 

When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.

#### Novel Intelligence

At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.

#### Tactical Analysis

Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.

nce you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

#### Recursive Deterrence

By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.

#### Singularity

Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Hardlight Architect

Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.

#### Hardlight Projector

When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points. 
Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the hardlight needle cantrip.

#### Hardlight Spellcasting

Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.

#### Lightforge

Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.

#### Prototype Luxcannon

By 10th level, you’ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.

#### Transient Avatar

At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Mastermaker

Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme—too unnatural—no matter what the results.

#### Thermalsight

Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.

#### Embedded Gadgets

At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can’t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.

#### Carbon Fiber Skin

At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.

#### Reconfigure

By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.

#### Construct Perfection

By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can’t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.

### Nanoengineer

While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.

#### Cutting-Edge Nanobots

Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.

##### Deconstruct. 

As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.

##### Nano-Hack. 

You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.

##### Reconstruct. 

As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.

#### Nano-Duplicate

Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.

#### Recycling Protocol

Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.

#### Nanite Weave

Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.

#### Network Response

Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.

## Gadgets

If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its #### Upgrade

If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.

### Adaptable Omnitool

This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:

#### Auto-Entry Device. 

This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier. 

#### Rebreather. 

You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.

#### Scanner. 

As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.

#### Taser. 

This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.

### Blink Button

This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.

### Bubble Projector

You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Chronoshifter

Prerequisite: 17th level

When you use your bonus action to activate this sophisticated, spherical device, you temporarily distort time, as per the spell time stop. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Death Ray

Prerequisite: 17th level

You construct a death ray magic item.

### F-MAC

Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 5th level

You integrate a set of thrusters into your construct, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.

### Feedback Electrodes

Prerequisites: Utility Matrix Prototype, 5th level

You’ve installed an electrical feedback system into your Utility Matrix. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 lightning damage to that creature. 

This damage improves as you gain higher levels in this class. At 11th level, you can deal 3d6 damage, and at 17th level, you can deal 4d6 damage.

### Flux Cannon

This gadget, which looks like a blaster ending in a series of lenses, modulates the temperature of matter. When you activate it as an action, you can chill or warm a 5-foot cube of nonliving matter within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried to a temperature you choose. You can heat or freeze most matter to extreme temperatures, resulting in different effects, depending on the material: heating water to its extreme causes it to boil, and chilling it causes it to freeze instantly; heating wood instantly causes it to combust, and freezing causes it to become more brittle; heating metal causes it to glow red-hot and become malleable, and chilling it causes it to become brittle and shrink slightly. At its extreme setting, this device can normally cause a change in its target's state of matter, especially if used on a target for multiple rounds, but the GM decides the exact effects on different materials.

### Focus Aperture

The short and long ranges of blasters you use is doubled, up to a maximum of 180/720 feet, or the blaster’s original range, whichever is longer.

### Gravity Manipulator

Prerequisite: 5th level

This blaster-like device emits a soft glow from the center of its conical muzzle. While holding it, you can activate one of the following effects:

#### Levitate. 

As an action, you nullify the gravitational forces on a Large or smaller creature or object weighing less than 500 pounds that you can see within 30 feet. The target is attracted to you and comes to rest in a space that you choose within 5 feet of you. You can move the target around you and choose its orientation on your turn. You can levitate a target for 1 minute at a time with this device. An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to resist this device's effects and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.

#### Repel. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can violently repel, in a direction that you choose, a target that is being levitated by this gadget. The target is pushed 60 feet if it is Tiny or Small size, 30 feet if it is Medium, or 15 feet if it is Large. If the target contacts an obstacle, both the target and the obstacle take 2d8 bludgeoning damage. If the target's shape permits, it can deal piercing or slashing damage, at the GM's discretion. The target is then no longer levitated by this gadget.

### Hologram Projector

Prerequisite: 13th level

When you activate this device as a bonus action, it produces an effect identical to the spell mirror image, except that it only creates one illusory duplicate of yourself. This duplicate lasts for 3 rounds, then dissipates. This is not a magical effect, doesn’t require your concentration, and can’t be dispelled with dispel magic or similar effects.

Upgrade (17th level). This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You gain two illusory duplicates, rather than one, when you use this gadget.

### Hypnosis Ray

Prerequisite: 13th level

This phaser-like device fires harmless swirls of colors to mesmerize a humanoid creature within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for up to 1 minute. While charmed, the target is incapacitated and its speed is 0. This effect ends early if the creature takes damage or if you use this device again. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this gadget for 24 hours.

### Invisibomb

Prerequisite: 5th level

When you activate this device as an action and throw it to a space within 30 feet, it produces a faint shimmer, and then each creature within 60 feet of it vanishes from sight. Each creature within that radius becomes invisible, as per invisibility, for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Jetpack

You construct a jetpack magic item.

Upgrade (13th level). This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can use this magic item for an unlimited amount of time each day.

### Jump Pad

When you deploy this rectangular device as an action, it unfolds into a 5-foot square panel that whirs with an upward thrust. Whenever a creature moves atop the panel, they are launched up to 30 feet in any direction they choose. The creature takes no falling damage for the first 30 feet it falls. The jump pad deactivates after 1 minute or when you collect it on your turn (no action required.)

### Magnet Boots

These weighty boots grant you the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

You can use two of your Utility Matrix’s devices as a bonus action. These devices must each activate as a bonus action.

### Micro-Missile

As an action, this wrist-mounted device fires a small homing missile at a target you can see within 30 feet. This missile automatically hits its target and deals 1d6 force damage. You fire additional missiles when you reach higher levels in this class: 2 missiles at 5th level, 3 missiles at 11th level, and 4 missiles at 17th level. You can direct the missiles at the same target or at different ones.

### Micro-Turret

As an action, this device can be thrown to any unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, where it transforms into a Small stationary blaster turret, which has AC 10 and 30 HP. Reducing the turret to 0 hit points disables it.

The turret makes a ranged attack roll (attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) against a creature you designate within 60 feet of it. On a hit, the turret deals 1d8 radiant damage. You can use your bonus action on subsequent turns to designate a target for the turret and command it to attack. After 1 minute, the turret deactivates and must charge for 1 minute before being deployed again.

#### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: When you command the turret to fire, you can choose for it to fire an overcharged shot, which deals 3d8 radiant damage on a hit. The turret then overheats, and can't be used to fire on the following turn.

### Molecular Destabilizer

As an action, you can activate this gadget, which looks like a blaster with a widely-flared muzzle. When you do so, it disintegrates a nonliving object you choose within 5 feet of you that can fit entirely within a 3-foot cube, reducing it into a fine dust. This gadget has no effect on metallic objects or magic items.

### Motion Tracker

Prerequisite: 9th level

You construct a motion tracker magic item.

### Omni-Grenade

Prerequisite: 5th level

As an action, you can prime this device to release a blast of elemental energy and throw it up to 30 feet. You can collect and reuse the device after it is thrown. When you prime the grenade, choose one of the following effects:

#### Fire. 

The grenade explodes in a scorching inferno. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire damage and an additional 2d8 fire damage at the beginning of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and none at the beginning of its next turn.

#### Ice. 

The grenade explodes with a cryogenic blast of frigid air. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn't halved.

#### Lightning. 

The grenade explodes in a crackling electric burst. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and can still take reactions.

This gadget improves as you gain levels in this class. At 11th level, you deal an additional 1d8 damage when a target fails its saving throw against your grenade, and at 17th level, you deal an additional 2d8 damage.

### Orbital Superweapon

Prerequisite: 17th level

You have pieced together a massive doomsday device, an orbital cannon, which you store in a pocket dimension for convenience. By throwing out a beacon, you can summon the weapon and fire it, as per the spell orbital hardlight cannon. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Overheat Beacon

As an action, you can activate this gadget, which produces a signal that causes every blaster within 60 feet to overheat. An overheated weapon can't be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again for 1 minute.

#### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: When you activate this gadget, you can choose any number of blasters within range to be unaffected by it.

### R-MAC

Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 17th level

You reinforce your MAC with high-density alloy bands. As a result, the construct has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

### Remote Gloves

These rocket-powered robotic gauntlets fly around following your every gesture. You can deploy the gauntlets or retrieve them as a bonus action. On each of your turns, without using an action, you can command each of the gauntlets to move up to 30 feet. The gauntlets will automatically stay within 30 feet of you, as they become inactive if they ever fall outside of this range.

You can assume control of the gauntlets to perform actions at a distance. When you do so, the gauntlets exactly mimic your hands, allowing you to manipulate objects and technological devices, store and retrieve items, or perform any other action for which you normally use your hands. Controlling each gauntlet requires a free hand and takes actions to perform tasks as if you were performing them yourself.  The gauntlets can't attack, activate magic items or gadgets, or carry more than 25 pounds each.

### Ricochet Aperture

Your weapon attacks using blasters ignore half and three-quarters cover, if there exists a solid surface off of which to ricochet the shot towards the target. You can target a creature in total cover with a ricocheted blaster attack with disadvantage if you know the target’s location within 5 feet.

### Rocket Fists

Prerequisites: Experimental Frame Prototype, 5th level

You have replaced your frame’s hands with rocket fists. The fists are ranged weapons with a range of 60/180, which use your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls. On a hit, a fist deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage. When you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon or a ranged attack with a rocket fist, you can make an additional ranged attack with a rocket fist as a bonus action. A launched rocket fist returns to you at the end of your turn.

### Self-Destruct Sequence

Prerequisites: Experimental Frame Prototype, 17th level

You’ve installed an explosive mechanism into your frame, allowing you to detonate it when you enter a special code as an action. When you enter the self-destruct code into your frame, you can specify that it detonates after 1 round, 3 rounds, or 10 rounds (1 minute). You can deactivate the self-destruct code as an action. The frame explodes in a 60-foot radius, destroying it completely. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can rebuild the frame with one week of work.

### Shrink Ray

Prerequisite: 9th level

As an action while holding this device, you can target a creature within 30 feet with the Reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell. This effect doesn’t require your concentration and can’t be dispelled with dispel magic or similar effects. Only one target can be affected by this gadget at a time.

#### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can use the Enlarge option of the enlarge/reduce spell when you use this device.

### Sonic Amplifier

This device, which is fitted with several large speakers on its face, can deaden or amplify sounds within range. When you activate the device as an action, choose one of the following effects:

#### Anti-Sound. 

A 20-foot radius sphere around you is rendered completely silent until the beginning of your next turn. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible within the area.

#### Noise Burst. 

The amplifier creates a sudden blast of white noise. Each creature you choose within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. This damage increases to 2d6 thunder damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

### Spectrum Visor

This visor has a single long slit, blipping with lights and sensors. As an action or bonus action, you can activate one of the following visor modes. Only one visor mode can be active at a time.

#### Aurasight. 

You can see a faint aura around any visible creature or object within 30 feet that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. This detection can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

#### Darkvision. 

You gain darkvision, which means you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

#### Thermalsight. 

You gain thermalsight, which means you can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier.

### Spell Cube

Prerequisite: 13th level

As a reaction when a spell of 1st to 5th level that would affect you is cast, you can trap it within the spell cube. The spell has no effect and is instead contained within the cube. The cube can only store one spell at a time. While holding the cube, you can cast the spell stored in it, expending it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.

### Stasis Field Generator

This device deploys a 5-foot diameter spherical forcefield around you as a reaction when you drop to 0 hit points. Until the beginning of your next turn, you are enveloped within this forcefield, which nothing—not physical objects, energy, or spell effects—can penetrate. The forcefield itself is immune to damage and you can’t be damaged further while within the sphere, nor do you make death saving throws. The sphere is weightless and can be moved while you're within it. At the beginning of your next turn, the sphere deactivates, and you are restored to consciousness with 1 hit point. Once this device activates, it can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can activate this gadget as a bonus action on your turn, placing you in the spherical forcefield and restoring 1 of your hit points.

### Tesla Mines

You gain a set of three electrical proximity mines. As an action, you can activate and throw a mine onto a surface within 40 feet, to which it firmly attaches. If a creature other than yourself enters the 5-foot cube area originating at the top of the mine, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and can’t move or take reactions until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half this amount of damage and can move and take reactions as normal.  You can disarm and recover a mine within 5 feet of you as an action. After 1 hour, a deployed mine burns out. You rebuild deployed and burned out mines during a long rest.

#### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: A mine triggers when a creature enters a 15-foot cube originating at the top of the mine.

### Transmat Deck

You construct a transmat deck magic item.

### Universal Translator

You construct a universal translator magic item and can also use it to read all writing.

### Version 1812 Multirocket Launcher

Prerequisite: 5th level

As an action, this device unfolds into a comically large multi-barrel rocket launcher, which proceeds to fire wildly in every direction while playing a grand overture. Each creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Zipgun

Prerequisite: 5th level

You build a zipgun magic item. This magic item’s save DC equals your Gadget save DC. Once this item burns out, you can rebuild it during a long rest.
