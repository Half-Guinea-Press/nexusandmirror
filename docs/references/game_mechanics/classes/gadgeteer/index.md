# Gadgeteer

A gnome tinkers at his workbench, fervently toiling with two precise instruments under a magnifying lens. Suddenly, a spark of blue electricity flashes across the room and scorches the far wall. The gnome grins and puts away his tools.

An amoeboid carefully positions a rabbit on a pedestal, stands back, and presses a large red button. With a pop and a puff of fur, the rabbit vanishes, only to hop back into the room seconds later, hairless from the waist down. The amoeboid nods and scratches down a few notes.

A bald human woman with a glowing, red, robotic eye tightens the joints on her new cybernetic arm. Her work complete, she rears back her metal fist and crushes a nearby chair.

Gadgeteers are masters of technology and engineering, turning every device available to their advantage. Assisted by their artificial intelligence companions, gadgeteers pursue the cutting edge of science and innovation, acquiring a mass of gadgets and a wealth of knowledge along the way.

## Cutting-Edge Innovators

Impelled by the lure of systems and logic, a wildly eccentric group embraces the sciences. These disparate tinkers, students, and inventors tend to be uniformly well-educated (or at least highly self-educated) in the principles of science, arcana, and engineering, with a particular focus on practical applications. Though most gadgeteers are at least curious about the underlying mysteries of the universe, many view groundbreaking scientific discoveries as a means to an end; theory only exists to facilitate application.

Fueled by breakthroughs and scientific advances, gadgeteers push the cutting edge of science and innovation, devising new technological marvels (or at least new blaster variants) at a breakneck pace. Some gadgeteers become absorbed in a particular problem, innovating and optimizing solutions for it alone, while others devise technological marvels wherever they can find application. All the great advances of the modern world, from datapads to Dark Matter engines, have been spearheaded by gadgeteers.

## AIs

A gadgeteer is rarely seen far from the floating holographic orb that is their Artificial Intelligence (AI) companion. After all, an organic brain can only hold so much information, whereas an AI can recall equations, trace schematics, and perform calculations with ease. Such intellect is nothing without a gadgeteer's ingenuity, of course, but the watchful eye of an AI can still spot errors that their creator might not have noticed.

But more than that, an AI companion is also a tireless friend. The endless work of a gadgeteer can often be monotonous and isolating, but the constant, friendly voice of an AI in one's ear goes a long way to preventing mad scientists and doomsday devices.

## Creating a Gadgeteer

When devising your gadgeteer, consider what draws your character to the sciences. Is it the challenge of working out a new puzzle, or the thrill of perfecting a new invention? Perhaps your character is obsessed with a particular facet of the universe, and longs to unravel its mysteries. Think about how you learned about science and engineering. Didyou have a mentor that shaped your understanding, or are you totally self-educated?

Also, consider which Prototype you’ll pick when you reach 2nd level. Are you interested in having a gadget for every situation, or do you just prefer having a big, hulking mech suit? Consider what this prototype means for your specialization and your character’s personality in general.

Lastly, put some thought into your AI. What’s its name, and what type of personality does it possess, if any?

## Quick Build

Follow these suggestions to quickly build a gadgeteer. Choose Intelligence as your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Investing in Constitution might also be wise for characters that intend to select the Experimental Frame Prototype at 2nd level. For your equipment, choose a researcher’s pack and an antimatter dagger. Lastly, choose the Technologist background.

## Class Features

As a gadgeteer, you gain the following class features:

### Hit Points

Hit Dice: 1d6 per gadgeteer level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per gadgeteer level after 1st

### Proficiencies

Armor: Light armor

Weapons: Simple and martial blasters, simple weapons

Tools: Alchemist’s supplies, circuitry kit, mechanist’s tools, ship maintenance tools, smith’s tools, tinker tools

Saving Throws: Dexterity, Intelligence

Skills: Choose three from Arcana, Data, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Piloting, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Technology

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- A repeater and any simple weapon
- (a) a martial blaster or (b) two simple blasters
- (a) a circuitry kit or (b) a mechanist’s tools
- An engineer’s pack and leather armor

### AI Companion

Beginning at 1st level, you are assisted by an AI companion, an intricate data construct which lives on your datapad and possesses near human-like levels of intelligence. When it manifests, it does so as a simple geometric projection; otherwise, it is merely a voice in your ear, checking your reasoning and informing you of relevant information. Your companion can solve any arithmetic or strictly logical problem you pose to it.

Additionally, whenever you make an Intelligence (Technology) check, you can treat the result as 10, or your gadgeteer level + your Intelligence modifier, whichever is higher.

Your AI companion downloads and integrates knowledge of additional subjects as you gain higher levels in this class. At 6th level, and again at 10th level and 15th level, you can choose one of the following skills to gain this benefit when you make an Intelligence check with it: Arcana, Data, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion.

### Gadgets

At 1st level, you begin to amass a collection of cutting-edge technological devices called gadgets. You gain one gadget of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. Because your gadgets are powered by your personal power cell, no other creature can use them. If one of your gadgets is lost or damaged, you can fashion a new one for no cost when you take a long rest.

You acquire additional gadgets as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Gadgeteer table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the gadgets you have and replace it with another one that you could gain at that level.

Your gadget options are detailed at the end of the class description.

Saving Throws. If one of your gadgets calls for a saving throw, its DC is calculated as follows:

Gadget save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

### Overcharge

With your technical aptitude and ingenuity, you can modify blasters to fire in more intense bursts. Starting at 2nd level, once on each of your turns when you hit a target with an attack from a blaster, you can deal an additional die of damage to that target.

This ability improves as you gain levels in this class. You add an additional die of damage at 5th level (2 dice), 11th level (3 dice), and 17th level (4 dice). Additionally, starting at 11th level, when you use this ability, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the blaster’s damage roll.

### Prototype

At 2nd level, you make a breakthrough innovation with a prototype of your own design. Choose one of the following three prototypes.

#### Experimental Frame

You have developed a sophisticated experimental frame, a powerful exo-suit that augments your strength and shelters you from harm. Your experimental frame counts as heavy armor, which you can don or doff as a bonus action, and it also grants you the benefits of a life suit. You are proficient with your experimental frame, but no other creature can wear it. While wearing your frame, you gain the following benefits:
- Your size becomes Medium, if it is smaller.
- Your movement speed increases to 30 feet, if it is less.
- Your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Intelligence modifier. This armor can't be enchanted or modified to improve its Armor Class.
- Whenever you begin your turn wearing this frame, you gain temporary hit points equal to your gadgeteer level. These hit points last until you remove the frame.
- You can integrate a simple or martial weapon directly into your frame, or you can integrate two weapons (one into each arm) if neither has the Two-Handed property. When you draw an integrated weapon, it snaps to your hand and you can’t be disarmed of it. Your frame is programmed in all manner of combat protocol, so you can use these integrated weapons proficiently while wearing your frame, even if you're not normally proficient in their use. You can switch which weapons are integrated when you finish a long rest.
- When you make an attack with an integrated melee weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls.
- Starting at 5th level, when you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon, you can make an additional melee attack using that weapon as a bonus action.

#### Mechanized Autonomous Construct

You have put the finishing touches on a Mechanized Autonomous Construct (a MAC), which is a specially-constructed automaton piloted by your AI.

The construct has statistics as shown above, and takes its own turn in combat immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command your construct if it is within 500 feet of you (no action required). You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. In combat, your construct's actions are governed by its Combat Protocols, which you can switch as a bonus action on your turn. If you are incapacitated or absent, your AI guides your construct to protect you and itself.

If your construct drops to 0 hit points, it becomes disabled. When you take a long rest, you can repair your
construct to its full hit points. You are always considered to have enough materials to build and repair your construct.

You can integrate weapons and gadgets directly into your construct. You can integrate one two-handed melee weapon, two one-handed melee weapons, or a one-handed melee weapon and a gadget. When your construct draws an integrated weapon or gadget, the item snaps to its hand and it can’t be disarmed of it. Your construct is proficient with any weapons integrated into it. The construct takes the Use an Object action to activate an integrated gadget.

Starting at 5th level, your construct makes two attacks, instead of one, when you command it to take the Attack action with its integrated weapons.

Constructed Nature. The construct doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

Combat Protocols. When it rolls initiative, the construct adopts one of two different modes of operation, Offensive or Defensive, which influences the actions it can take in combat. Offensive Mode. While in this mode, attacks against the construct have advantage. The construct can take the Attack (melee weapon attacks only), Dash, Ready, and Use an Object actions on its turn.

Defensive Mode. While in this mode, melee attacks against the construct's creator have disadvantage while the attacker is within the construct's reach. The construct can take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, and Use an Object actions on its turn.

Actions

Integrated Mace. Melee Weapon Attack: its creator’s Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Impulse Leap. The construct launches itself up to 30 feet in any direction, without provoking opportunity attacks.

#### Utility Matrix

You have developed a utility matrix, an advanced, cube-shaped mechanism that rearranges its form and function into that of other devices. Your matrix can become any of the following gadgets, which you can use at will:

##### Cloaking Device. 

As an action, you can activate your cloaking device to temporarily warp the light around you and hide yourself from view. You become invisible until the beginning of your next turn, or until you make an attack, cast a spell, or use a gadget. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Flashbang. 

As a bonus action, you throw a concussive bomb at your feet, disorienting and distracting nearby foes. Each creature within 5 feet of you can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Forcefield Projector. 

As a bonus action, you can activate your forcefield projector, temporarily sheltering yourself behind a powerful electromagnetic field. Until the beginning of your next turn, your Armor Class increases by your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Grappling Hook. 

As a reaction when you fall, or as a bonus action on your turn, you can project a grappling hook at a target location you can see within your movement speed. If the target location can hold your weight, you are pulled there, expending movement normally. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again on the following round.

##### Modular Gadget. 

Starting at 5th level, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an un-upgraded gadget of your choice that does not have prerequisites. This gadget doesn't count against your total number of gadgets known. Alternately, you can reconfigure your utility matrix into an upgrade for an existing gadget for which you meet prerequisites. Once you reconfigure your utility matrix, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Tech Specialty

Beginning at 3rd level, you adopt a tech specialty that informs your gadgeteering expertise. Choose one Tech Specialty option. Your selection grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Bluescreen Protocol

Beginning at 7th level, you have integrated a complex construct-disabling algorithm into your AI companion, which you can activate as an action. Each construct within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage against your Gadget save DC. On a failed save, a construct is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the beginning of your next turn, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Override Protocol

At 18th level, your AI companion can upload a devastating virus to seize control of a construct. You can use your action to touch a construct within your reach, which must succeed a Wisdom saving throw against your Gadget save DC or be charmed by you for 1 hour, even if it would otherwise be immune to being charmed. While it is charmed, you can issue commands to the construct while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as attack that creature, run over there, or fetch that object. If the construct completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Antimagic Pulse

By 20th level, you perfect a cutting-edge device capable of producing an antimagic pulse (abbreviated AMP), a type of energetic burst that completely disrupts and disables magic and machines. You can use your action to throw this device to a location within 60 feet, which explodes in a flash of blue light. This device creates an antimagic field (as per the spell) for 1 minute centered on the device, with the following changes: 

- The effect is a 20-foot radius sphere.
- Magical technology (including your gadgets and blasters) count as magic items and are suppressed within the sphere. Blasters can’t be used to make attacks while within the sphere, and attacks with them can’t penetrate into it.
- Constructs within the sphere are paralyzed for the duration, even if they would otherwise be immune to this condition.

Destroying the device once it is thrown doesn't end its effects early. Once you use this device, it fizzles out. You can make a new one when you finish a long rest.
