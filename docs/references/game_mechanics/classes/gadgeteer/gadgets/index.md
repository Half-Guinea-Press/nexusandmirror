# Gadgets

If a gadget or an upgrade has prerequisites, you must meet them to gain it. You can gain a gadget or upgrade at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

Your gadgets count as magical technology. You must have a gadget before you can select its ### Upgrade

If a gadget calls for a spell or magic item which requires a saving throw, its uses your Gadget save DC.

## Adaptable Omnitool

This gadget can be configured into a number of useful devices, including the following:

### Auto-Entry Device. 

This device automatically attempts to crack physical locks or hack powered doors when set to do so as an action. Its ability check for doing so is 10 + your Intelligence modifier. 

### Rebreather. 

You can start or stop breathing through this apparatus as a bonus action. When doing so, you can breathe normally in airless environments. This device also shelters you from toxic fumes and other airborne poisons. You can't talk while breathing through this device.

### Scanner. 

As an action, you can use your handheld scanner to analyze the electromagnetic spectrum around you. Your scanner detects the presence, number, and type of technological devices within 30 feet of you and can determine whether or not a unique construct or device has been present in the area within the last hour.

### Taser. 

This device produces a debilitating current of electricity when you use it as an action. Make a melee attack roll (attack bonus equals your Intelligence bonus + your proficiency modifier) against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. This damage increases to 2d8 lightning damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.

## Blink Button

This complicated looking device has a single large red button on its face. When you press it as an action, you teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied location of your choice that you can see.

## Bubble Projector

You construct a device that, as an action, creates a dome of force as if you had cast the spell geodesic shield. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Chronoshifter

Prerequisite: 17th level

When you use your bonus action to activate this sophisticated, spherical device, you temporarily distort time, as per the spell time stop. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Death Ray

Prerequisite: 17th level

You construct a death ray magic item.

## F-MAC

Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 5th level

You integrate a set of thrusters into your construct, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.

## Feedback Electrodes

Prerequisites: Utility Matrix Prototype, 5th level

You’ve installed an electrical feedback system into your Utility Matrix. When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 2d6 lightning damage to that creature. 

This damage improves as you gain higher levels in this class. At 11th level, you can deal 3d6 damage, and at 17th level, you can deal 4d6 damage.

## Flux Cannon

This gadget, which looks like a blaster ending in a series of lenses, modulates the temperature of matter. When you activate it as an action, you can chill or warm a 5-foot cube of nonliving matter within 30 feet that isn't being worn or carried to a temperature you choose. You can heat or freeze most matter to extreme temperatures, resulting in different effects, depending on the material: heating water to its extreme causes it to boil, and chilling it causes it to freeze instantly; heating wood instantly causes it to combust, and freezing causes it to become more brittle; heating metal causes it to glow red-hot and become malleable, and chilling it causes it to become brittle and shrink slightly. At its extreme setting, this device can normally cause a change in its target's state of matter, especially if used on a target for multiple rounds, but the GM decides the exact effects on different materials.

## Focus Aperture

The short and long ranges of blasters you use is doubled, up to a maximum of 180/720 feet, or the blaster’s original range, whichever is longer.

## Gravity Manipulator

Prerequisite: 5th level

This blaster-like device emits a soft glow from the center of its conical muzzle. While holding it, you can activate one of the following effects:

### Levitate. 

As an action, you nullify the gravitational forces on a Large or smaller creature or object weighing less than 500 pounds that you can see within 30 feet. The target is attracted to you and comes to rest in a space that you choose within 5 feet of you. You can move the target around you and choose its orientation on your turn. You can levitate a target for 1 minute at a time with this device. An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to resist this device's effects and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.

### Repel. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can violently repel, in a direction that you choose, a target that is being levitated by this gadget. The target is pushed 60 feet if it is Tiny or Small size, 30 feet if it is Medium, or 15 feet if it is Large. If the target contacts an obstacle, both the target and the obstacle take 2d8 bludgeoning damage. If the target's shape permits, it can deal piercing or slashing damage, at the GM's discretion. The target is then no longer levitated by this gadget.

## Hologram Projector

Prerequisite: 13th level

When you activate this device as a bonus action, it produces an effect identical to the spell mirror image, except that it only creates one illusory duplicate of yourself. This duplicate lasts for 3 rounds, then dissipates. This is not a magical effect, doesn’t require your concentration, and can’t be dispelled with dispel magic or similar effects.

Upgrade (17th level). This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You gain two illusory duplicates, rather than one, when you use this gadget.

## Hypnosis Ray

Prerequisite: 13th level

This phaser-like device fires harmless swirls of colors to mesmerize a humanoid creature within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for up to 1 minute. While charmed, the target is incapacitated and its speed is 0. This effect ends early if the creature takes damage or if you use this device again. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this gadget for 24 hours.

## Invisibomb

Prerequisite: 5th level

When you activate this device as an action and throw it to a space within 30 feet, it produces a faint shimmer, and then each creature within 60 feet of it vanishes from sight. Each creature within that radius becomes invisible, as per invisibility, for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Jetpack

You construct a jetpack magic item.

Upgrade (13th level). This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can use this magic item for an unlimited amount of time each day.

## Jump Pad

When you deploy this rectangular device as an action, it unfolds into a 5-foot square panel that whirs with an upward thrust. Whenever a creature moves atop the panel, they are launched up to 30 feet in any direction they choose. The creature takes no falling damage for the first 30 feet it falls. The jump pad deactivates after 1 minute or when you collect it on your turn (no action required.)

## Magnet Boots

These weighty boots grant you the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

## Mega-Gizmo

Prerequisite: Utility Matrix Prototype, 17th level

You can use two of your Utility Matrix’s devices as a bonus action. These devices must each activate as a bonus action.

## Micro-Missile

As an action, this wrist-mounted device fires a small homing missile at a target you can see within 30 feet. This missile automatically hits its target and deals 1d6 force damage. You fire additional missiles when you reach higher levels in this class: 2 missiles at 5th level, 3 missiles at 11th level, and 4 missiles at 17th level. You can direct the missiles at the same target or at different ones.

## Micro-Turret

As an action, this device can be thrown to any unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, where it transforms into a Small stationary blaster turret, which has AC 10 and 30 HP. Reducing the turret to 0 hit points disables it.

The turret makes a ranged attack roll (attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) against a creature you designate within 60 feet of it. On a hit, the turret deals 1d8 radiant damage. You can use your bonus action on subsequent turns to designate a target for the turret and command it to attack. After 1 minute, the turret deactivates and must charge for 1 minute before being deployed again.

### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: When you command the turret to fire, you can choose for it to fire an overcharged shot, which deals 3d8 radiant damage on a hit. The turret then overheats, and can't be used to fire on the following turn.

## Molecular Destabilizer

As an action, you can activate this gadget, which looks like a blaster with a widely-flared muzzle. When you do so, it disintegrates a nonliving object you choose within 5 feet of you that can fit entirely within a 3-foot cube, reducing it into a fine dust. This gadget has no effect on metallic objects or magic items.

## Motion Tracker

Prerequisite: 9th level

You construct a motion tracker magic item.

## Omni-Grenade

Prerequisite: 5th level

As an action, you can prime this device to release a blast of elemental energy and throw it up to 30 feet. You can collect and reuse the device after it is thrown. When you prime the grenade, choose one of the following effects:

### Fire. 

The grenade explodes in a scorching inferno. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 fire damage and an additional 2d8 fire damage at the beginning of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and none at the beginning of its next turn.

### Ice. 

The grenade explodes with a cryogenic blast of frigid air. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn't halved.

### Lightning. 

The grenade explodes in a crackling electric burst. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 lightning damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and can still take reactions.

This gadget improves as you gain levels in this class. At 11th level, you deal an additional 1d8 damage when a target fails its saving throw against your grenade, and at 17th level, you deal an additional 2d8 damage.

## Orbital Superweapon

Prerequisite: 17th level

You have pieced together a massive doomsday device, an orbital cannon, which you store in a pocket dimension for convenience. By throwing out a beacon, you can summon the weapon and fire it, as per the spell orbital hardlight cannon. You don't need to concentrate on this spell. Once you use this gadget, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Overheat Beacon

As an action, you can activate this gadget, which produces a signal that causes every blaster within 60 feet to overheat. An overheated weapon can't be used to make an attack again until the end of your next turn. Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again for 1 minute.

### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: When you activate this gadget, you can choose any number of blasters within range to be unaffected by it.

## R-MAC

Prerequisites: Mechanized Autonomous Construct prototype, 17th level

You reinforce your MAC with high-density alloy bands. As a result, the construct has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons.

## Remote Gloves

These rocket-powered robotic gauntlets fly around following your every gesture. You can deploy the gauntlets or retrieve them as a bonus action. On each of your turns, without using an action, you can command each of the gauntlets to move up to 30 feet. The gauntlets will automatically stay within 30 feet of you, as they become inactive if they ever fall outside of this range.

You can assume control of the gauntlets to perform actions at a distance. When you do so, the gauntlets exactly mimic your hands, allowing you to manipulate objects and technological devices, store and retrieve items, or perform any other action for which you normally use your hands. Controlling each gauntlet requires a free hand and takes actions to perform tasks as if you were performing them yourself.  The gauntlets can't attack, activate magic items or gadgets, or carry more than 25 pounds each.

## Ricochet Aperture

Your weapon attacks using blasters ignore half and three-quarters cover, if there exists a solid surface off of which to ricochet the shot towards the target. You can target a creature in total cover with a ricocheted blaster attack with disadvantage if you know the target’s location within 5 feet.

## Rocket Fists

Prerequisites: Experimental Frame Prototype, 5th level

You have replaced your frame’s hands with rocket fists. The fists are ranged weapons with a range of 60/180, which use your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls. On a hit, a fist deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage. When you make a melee weapon attack with an integrated weapon or a ranged attack with a rocket fist, you can make an additional ranged attack with a rocket fist as a bonus action. A launched rocket fist returns to you at the end of your turn.

## Self-Destruct Sequence

Prerequisites: Experimental Frame Prototype, 17th level

You’ve installed an explosive mechanism into your frame, allowing you to detonate it when you enter a special code as an action. When you enter the self-destruct code into your frame, you can specify that it detonates after 1 round, 3 rounds, or 10 rounds (1 minute). You can deactivate the self-destruct code as an action. The frame explodes in a 60-foot radius, destroying it completely. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can rebuild the frame with one week of work.

## Shrink Ray

Prerequisite: 9th level

As an action while holding this device, you can target a creature within 30 feet with the Reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell. This effect doesn’t require your concentration and can’t be dispelled with dispel magic or similar effects. Only one target can be affected by this gadget at a time.

### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can use the Enlarge option of the enlarge/reduce spell when you use this device.

## Sonic Amplifier

This device, which is fitted with several large speakers on its face, can deaden or amplify sounds within range. When you activate the device as an action, choose one of the following effects:

### Anti-Sound. 

A 20-foot radius sphere around you is rendered completely silent until the beginning of your next turn. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible within the area.

### Noise Burst. 

The amplifier creates a sudden blast of white noise. Each creature you choose within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6 thunder damage. This damage increases to 2d6 thunder damage at when you reach 5th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 17th level.

## Spectrum Visor

This visor has a single long slit, blipping with lights and sensors. As an action or bonus action, you can activate one of the following visor modes. Only one visor mode can be active at a time.

### Aurasight. 

You can see a faint aura around any visible creature or object within 30 feet that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any. This detection can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Darkvision. 

You gain darkvision, which means you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Thermalsight. 

You gain thermalsight, which means you can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier.

## Spell Cube

Prerequisite: 13th level

As a reaction when a spell of 1st to 5th level that would affect you is cast, you can trap it within the spell cube. The spell has no effect and is instead contained within the cube. The cube can only store one spell at a time. While holding the cube, you can cast the spell stored in it, expending it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell.

## Stasis Field Generator

This device deploys a 5-foot diameter spherical forcefield around you as a reaction when you drop to 0 hit points. Until the beginning of your next turn, you are enveloped within this forcefield, which nothing—not physical objects, energy, or spell effects—can penetrate. The forcefield itself is immune to damage and you can’t be damaged further while within the sphere, nor do you make death saving throws. The sphere is weightless and can be moved while you're within it. At the beginning of your next turn, the sphere deactivates, and you are restored to consciousness with 1 hit point. Once this device activates, it can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: You can activate this gadget as a bonus action on your turn, placing you in the spherical forcefield and restoring 1 of your hit points.

## Tesla Mines

You gain a set of three electrical proximity mines. As an action, you can activate and throw a mine onto a surface within 40 feet, to which it firmly attaches. If a creature other than yourself enters the 5-foot cube area originating at the top of the mine, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and can’t move or take reactions until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half this amount of damage and can move and take reactions as normal.  You can disarm and recover a mine within 5 feet of you as an action. After 1 hour, a deployed mine burns out. You rebuild deployed and burned out mines during a long rest.

### Upgrade

This gadget can be chosen twice, gaining the following upgrade when you select it the second time: A mine triggers when a creature enters a 15-foot cube originating at the top of the mine.

## Transmat Deck

You construct a transmat deck magic item.

## Universal Translator

You construct a universal translator magic item and can also use it to read all writing.

## Version 1812 Multirocket Launcher

Prerequisite: 5th level

As an action, this device unfolds into a comically large multi-barrel rocket launcher, which proceeds to fire wildly in every direction while playing a grand overture. Each creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

Once you use this gadget, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Zipgun

Prerequisite: 5th level

You build a zipgun magic item. This magic item’s save DC equals your Gadget save DC. Once this item burns out, you can rebuild it during a long rest.
