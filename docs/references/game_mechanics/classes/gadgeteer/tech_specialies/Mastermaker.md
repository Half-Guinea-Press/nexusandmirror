# Mastermaker

Nearly all gadgeteers strive for perfection in their work, but mastermakers take this to a logical extreme: using the technology at their disposal, they seek to engineer away their own biological defects. By grafting gadgets and technology onto their bodies (and making liberal use of vect components), mastermakers gradually become hybrids of humanoids and machines. They are stronger, tougher, and more agile than their counterparts, but many would argue that their techniques are too extreme—too unnatural—no matter what the results.

## Thermalsight

Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have installed a vect optical sensor in place of one of your eyes, granting you thermalsight. You can see living creatures through darkness and heavily obscured conditions, such as fog, out to a range of 30 feet. You can also determine if a creature is living or dead though its body heat. However, you can't discern color, nor use this sense to see through illusions, invisibility, or magical darkness. This sense is blocked by one inch of any solid barrier. If you already had thermalsight, its range increases by 30 feet.

## Embedded Gadgets

At 3rd level, you can install one gadget or a one-handed blaster directly into one of your arms. You can’t be disarmed of this item and you can use it if at least one of your hands is free. Additionally, you can perfectly conceal this item, so long as another creature does not inspect the metal plates installed in your arm. You can change which gadget or blaster you have embedded when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you don’t lose hit points or hit dice from installing or removing construct grafts, and it takes you no time to recover after the attachment of a new graft.

## Carbon Fiber Skin

At 6th level, you have installed a durable metallic mesh under much of your skin, and metallic plates to protect your organs. Your Armor Class increases by 1.

## Reconfigure

By 10th level, enough of your body is mechanical that you can reconfigure your parts to improve your agility, might, or even intellect. One ability score of your choice increases by 2 and you can change this selection whenever you finish a long rest. You can't increase Constitution using this trait and you can't increase any ability score above 20.

## Construct Perfection

By 14th level, you have achieved the height of construct superiority by installing a construct core directly into your head. You no longer need to sleep and magic can’t put you to sleep. You are immune to being charmed, frightened, or possessed. Additionally, the maximum for your Intelligence score is now 22.
