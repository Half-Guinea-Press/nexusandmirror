# Hardlight Architect

Hardlight might well be the penultimate arcane discovery. It is a strong yet malleable material, conjured fully-shaped from energy alone, and it can be used to construct entire functional systems in a flash. Through hardlight, engineers and arcanists can spontaneously prototype new designs in real space and replicate these designs later. Hardlight architects recognize the monumental importance of this material and dedicate their ambition and creativity to mastering it. As you perfect all the established hardlight spells, you constantly dream up new, innovative uses for the material, awaiting the day you can conjure a towering suit of hardlight power armor to crush your enemies and intimidate your rivals.

## Hardlight Projector

When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you construct a hardlight projector, a device capable of forming hardlight and shaping it to your whims. If the projector is lost or destroyed, you can construct a new one over a long rest for 200 gp. By using this device as an action, you can create a simple geometrical object of shimmering hardlight which must fit within a 1-foot cube. Whatever its shape, the object weighs 1 pound, lasts for 1 minute, has AC 10, and has 5 hit points. 
Additionally, you can use the projector to cast the hardlight needle cantrip.

## Hardlight Spellcasting

Also at 3rd level, you can use your hardlight projector to emulate the actions of a spellcaster, enabling you to create more substantial hardlight spells. Your spell save DC for these spells equals your Gadget save DC and your spell attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

You can cast the spells hardlight blaster and hardlight nails once each and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Additionally, at 6th level, you can cast the spells hardlight construction and hardlight gauntlet once each. At 14th level, you can cast the spell hardlight frame once. You regain the ability to cast each of these spells when you finish a long rest.

## Lightforge

Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can forge a shield, a set of artisan tools, or any melee weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, entirely out of scintillating hardlight. After 10 minutes, this object evaporates completely into light.

## Prototype Luxcannon

By 10th level, youâ€™ve perfected a stable hardlight weapon, which you can conjure effortlessly. You can cast the spell hardlight blaster at will and can apply your Overcharge feature to the spell.

## Transient Avatar

At 14th level, you can cast the spell conjure hardlight avatar without using a spell slot or spell components as a bonus action. The spell's duration is until the end of your next turn. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
