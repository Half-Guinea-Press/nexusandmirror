# Futurist

As a futurist, you believe that artificial intelligence is the zenith of all invention. To engineer a perfect AI, one which is capable of inventing on its own merits, is to conquer limitless problems by proxy. After all, an advanced AI which doesn't degrade into a rogue intelligence could turn its vastly superior intellect to dramatically improving the world, innovating in ways organic minds couldn't imagine. Your experiments with neural networks and intelligence theory have steadily edged you closer to finding such an AI, and granted your AI companion newfound aptitude along the way.

## Advanced Subroutines

Starting when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your AI takes a more active role in assisting you, rather than merely chirping up from time to time. Your AI can run any of the following subroutines, and you can command it to switch between subroutines as a bonus action.

### Genetic Algorithm.

When you take damage from a hostile creature, subtract 1 from the damage dealt. Each additional time you take damage while this subroutine is running, the amount you subtract from the damage dealt increases by 1, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. This amount resets to 1 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.

### Heatmap. 

When you have advantage on a weapon attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage.

### Neural Network. 

When you use the Attack action to attack a hostile creature and miss, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus to subsequent attack rolls you make while this subroutine is running, up to a maximum of your Intelligence modifier. You don't increase this bonus if you attempt to attack a creature that you can't see or a creature that can't be hit. This amount resets to 0 after 1 minute or when you switch subroutines.

## Novel Intelligence

At 3rd level, you have vastly improved your AI's intellect. Your AI Companion feature applies its benefit to another Intelligence skill of your choice. Additionally, your AI knows all languages and can perfectly recall everything it has seen and heard within the last 30 days.

## Tactical Analysis

Starting at 6th level, as a bonus action, you can command your AI to perform a full evaluation of your strategic options and advise you of likely scenarios. Until the beginning of your next turn, you have advantage on the next attack roll you make, and the next attack roll made against you has disadvantage.

nce you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Recursive Deterrence

By 10th level, your AI has implemented passive routines that scan for incoming blaster fire and ready you for counterattack. As a reaction when a creature within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack targeting that creature.

## Singularity

Beginning at 14th level, your AI is nearly prescient. As a bonus action, you can allow your AI to override your very movements, guiding your shots to where targets will be. For the next minute, whenever you make a ranged attack roll and don't have disadvantage, you can treat the result as being equal to your gadgeteer level.

Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
