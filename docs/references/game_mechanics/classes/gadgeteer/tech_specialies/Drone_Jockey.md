# Drone Jockey

Most gadgeteers tinker with drones at some point in their career; after all, they’re compact, useful projects, with a limited number of moving parts. However, only drone jockeys take this to the extreme of arming themselves with a small army of programmed drones. By linking the drones’ sensors and construct cores, they create a more cunning swarm intelligence, distributed over the drone network as a whole. This swarm can act almost autonomously, scouting the area and defending the jockey with mechanical efficiency.

## Hivemaster

Starting when you choose this specialty, you gain a special drone controller magic item and a pair of drones. These drones can be any two of the following three: a defense drone, a medical drone, or a recon drone (see Monsters chapter for statistics). Your drone controller is linked to both drones and you can use your bonus action to command all of your drones at once. 

Your drones are improved in the following ways:

- You can add your level to the HP of your drones.
- When one of your drones makes an attack, its attack bonus equals your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
- When your medical drone heals a creature, it restores 1d10 hit points. - Your recon drone marks three creatures it can see, instead of only one.

You gain an additional drone of your choice at 6th level (3 drones), 10th level (4 drones), and 14th level (5 drones).

Your drone controller can only command three drones at a time, and only two of those drones can be the same type, but you can deploy a stored drone as an action if one becomes disabled. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can retrofit one of your drones, changing it into a different type.

## Sacrificial Dive

At 6th level, when you are targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to command one of your drones within 5 feet of you to fly in the way of the attack. This attack targets the drone instead.

## Focus Fire

Beginning at 10th level, your AI companion takes direct control of your drones, aiming and firing them as you direct. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can command your drones without using a bonus action.

## Omega Drone

At 14th level, as an action, you can combine three of your drones (a defense drone, a medical drone, and a recon drone) into a single omega drone. Once combined, the omega drone’s AC equals 10 + your Intelligence modifier, its HP equals 5 times your level, and its ability scores are all 14. 
The drone can take all the actions of its constituent drones and takes its own turn immediately after yours in initiative, acting as directed by your AI. On a hit with its integrated blaster, it deals 3d6 radiant damage.

Your drone controller can't link to other drones while your omega drone is active. You can separate your omega drone back into its constituent drones as an action.
