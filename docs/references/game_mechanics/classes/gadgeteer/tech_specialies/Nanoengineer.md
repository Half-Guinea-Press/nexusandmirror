# Nanoengineer

While other gadgeteers tinker with machines that fit in the palm of your hand, your machinations are smaller and your ambitions grander. As a nanoengineer, you work with nanomachines, unfathomably tiny robots capable of massive feats, from stitching together wounds at the microscopic level, to forming extraordinarily resilient materials. Your machines might appear as nothing more than a small blob of gray ooze, but once set to work, their effects are unmistakable.

## Cutting-Edge Nanobots

Beginning when you choose this specialty at 3rd level, you have assembled a fabricator which generates a steady stream of advanced nanobots, called nanites. Your supply of nanites is represented by a pool of Nano points equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your gadgeteer level, rounded down. You can expend Nano points to employ your nanobots in varying ways, described below, and you regain all expended Nano points when you finish a long rest.

### Deconstruct. 

As an action, you well up a mass of nanites in your hand and fling them at a target within 15 feet of you. Spend any number of Nano points and make a ranged attack roll if the target is out of your reach; you automatically hit if the target is within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage per Nano point expended as the nanites unravel it at a cellular level.

### Nano-Hack. 

You can expend up to 3 Nano points when you make an Intelligence (Data) check to hack a piece of technology, inserting your nanites into the machine. You can add 1d4 to the roll for each Nano point expended.

### Reconstruct. 

As an action, you can expend any number of Nano points to create a thin stream of nanites to repair damage and mend wounds of a willing target within 15 feet of you. The target regains 1d6 hit points per Nano point expended.

## Nano-Duplicate

Also at 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can use your nanites to duplicate the exact shape, but not color or texture, of an object you touch that can fit within a 1-foot cube. The replica is made of nanites and lasts for 10 minutes.

## Recycling Protocol

Starting at 6th level, you've programmed your nanites to repurpose material and multiply. When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points using a melee weapon attack or your Deconstruct ability, you regain 2 expended Nano points.

## Nanite Weave

Starting at 10th level, you can use your action and spend up to 3 Nano points to stitch your nanites together in a protective mesh above your skin. These Nano points are invested in the mesh; you can have up to 3 points invested at once. While you aren't wielding a shield, you gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the number of Nano points invested. Whenever you take damage, nanites in the mesh are destroyed and you lose 1 invested point.

## Network Response

Starting at 14th level, you can use your reaction when you take damage to use your Deconstruct ability, targeting the attacker, or Reconstruct ability, targeting yourself, spending up to 3 Nano points on either ability.
