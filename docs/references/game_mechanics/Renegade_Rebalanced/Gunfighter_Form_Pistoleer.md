# Gunfighter Form(Pistoleer)

Additionally, when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you begin constructing a custom firearm that suits your unique brand of renegade style. This process begins by selecting the form upon which to base your weapon. Each form grants you a new ability and unlocks certain upgrades you can add to your weapon at higher levels.

## Pistoleer

Favoring speed and style over raw power, a renegade who adopts the Pistoleer form wields a small flintlock handgun. As an action on your turn, you can target a creature within 30 feet and shoot. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. You are proficient with the attack, and on a hit, the attack deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity modifier. The number of shots you can fire during a single action increases when you reach higher levels in this subclass: two shots at 5th level, three shots at 11th level, and four shots at 20th level. The shots can target the same creature or different creatures. Make a separate attack roll for each shot.
