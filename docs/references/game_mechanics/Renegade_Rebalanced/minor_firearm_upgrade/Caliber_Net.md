# Minor Firearm Upgrade: Caliber Net

By repurposing some salvaged Hextech parts, you equip your gun with an arcane net meant to trap opponents. As an action, choose a creature within range of your firearm. The creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature twice, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
