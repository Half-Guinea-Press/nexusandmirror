# Minor Firearm Upgrade: Blade and Black Powder

Prerequisite: Pistoleer Form

You create a matching blade to accompany your firearm, this blade has the statistics of a shortsword, rendering you a deadly opponent in both melee and ranged combat. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. Additionally, when you use your action to shoot using your Gunfighter Form, you can use your bonus action to strike at a creature within melee range with that blade. You can also attack normally using this blade.
