# Grin and Bear It

At 10th level, you can brace yourself in the heat of battle, even when gravely wounded. When you use your Second Wind feature, your AC gains a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier, your movement speed increases by 20 feet, and you don't trigger attacks of opportunity until the start of your next turn.
