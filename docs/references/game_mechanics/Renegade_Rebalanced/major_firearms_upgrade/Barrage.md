# Major Firearm Upgrade: Barrage

As an action, you can fire a barrage of bullets. Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from yourself must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking piercing damage equal to 3d10 + your Dexterity modifier on a failure and half as much on a success. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
