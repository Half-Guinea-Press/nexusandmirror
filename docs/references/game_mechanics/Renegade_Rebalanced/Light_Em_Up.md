# Light ‘Em Up

At 18th level, you learn to channel the volatile force of your firearm’s black powder into a single concussive blast. As a bonus action, you can either throw or set down a small explosive. If thrown, the explosive has a range of 30 feet and detonates immediately on impact; if set down, the explosive can be detonated remotely from up to 60 feet away as another bonus action.

When detonated, each creature within a 15-foot radius of the explosive must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d6 force damage on a failure and half as much on a success. The DC for this saving throw is equal to your Firearm Upgrade DC.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
