# Weapon of Choice

Through a combination of salvaging stolen pieces of arcane technology and sheer rakish ingenuity, you can customize your firearm with various upgrades. When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, pick one minor upgrade and one major upgrade from the Firearm Upgrades list. If an upgrade has a prerequisite, you must meet that prerequisite in order to benefit from the upgrade.

You gain one additional minor upgrade at 5th and 15th level, and one additional major upgrade at 10th level. When you gain a level in this class you swap upgrades for upgrades of the same tier.
