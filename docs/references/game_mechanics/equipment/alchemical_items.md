Interact

Kept as a closely guarded secret by the deadly members of the Red Mantis assassins, this poison is treated with reverence for its ability to end lives. If the victim dies while affected by this poison, its body decomposes to nothing in 1 minute, leaving only its gear behind. Non-magical preservation can't protect the tainted corpse. Gentle repose works on the poisoned body only if cast as a 5th-level spell and the caster succeeds at a counteract check against the poison's saving throw DC when casting the spell. Even if cast successfully, gentle repose only works as if it had been cast at 2nd level.

Saving Throw DC 42 Fortitude; Maximum Duration 6 rounds; Stage 1 7d12 poison damage and doomed 1 (1 round); Stage 2 9d12 poison damage and doomed 2 (1 round) Stage 3 11d12 poison damage and doomed 3 (1 round)

[one-action]

Interact

When you use a dose of addiction suppressant, it suppresses the effects of that addiction for 1 day, as if you had taken an actual dose of the drug, but without any of the drug's effects, and it doesn't increase the addiction DC. You also gain an item bonus against the ongoing save against the drug's addiction depending on the type of addiction suppressant.

For every drug, a specific suppressant must be crafted— no generalized addiction suppressant yet exists. In order to create an addiction suppressant, you must begin with a dose of the drug to be suppressed, then use alchemical reagents to generate an elixir that can be used to fight that drug's addiction. An addiction suppressant must be a higher level than the drug it is meant to suppress in order to work.

Special An addiction suppressant has the same rarity as the specific drug it's crafted to suppress.

Certain Scarlet Triad poisoners use toxins like addlebrain to keep captured prisoners docile and compliant for short periods of time until they can be properly shackled and imprisoned. Addlebrain is distilled from a hallucinogenic lichen that can often be found growing in the sewers below particularly large cities like Katapesh.

Once soaked in special reagents and then dried, a dose of addlebrain must be either lit with flame or tossed into a fire to activate, whereupon it unleashes a cloud of toxin as normal for an inhaled poison.

## Alchemical Atomizer

Item 10

Rare

Alchemical

Source Legends pg. 80

Price 175 gp

Usage held in 1 hand

Bulk L

Khismar developed this unique atomizer that allows for the distribution of elixirs, oils, and potions as a fine spray or mist. The atomizer can hold a single elixir, oil, or potion. An atomizer contains enough reagents to use it up to 10 times before the reagents must be replaced. A new batch of reagents costs 5 gp and requires an Interact action to replace.

Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You spray the contents of the atomizer on yourself or an adjacent willing ally or unattended object. The target gains the effects of the applied elixir, oil, or potion. The target must be a valid target for the effect, such as food or drink for a nectar of purification, or the consumable is lost.

Activate [two-actions] Interact; Effect You cause the atomizer to mix its reagents and fire its held consumable at a square within 30 feet. The consumable forms a cloud that fills the space. The first willing valid target to enter the space automatically gains the effect of the consumable. If there are multiple valid targets, such as with multiple weapons for aligned oil, the creature entering the space determines how the effect is applied. The cloud is consumed upon contact with a willing valid target or at the start of your next turn, whichever comes first.

Usage held in 1 hand

Bulk L

Activate

[one-action]

Interact

An alchemical fuse is a length of treated cord that can be used to time the detonation of an alchemical bomb or a stick of pyronite, or simply as a timer—at the GM's option, fuses can be used as timers to trigger other devices that can be triggered with a single appropriate action, as well.

Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You attach the alchemical fuse to an alchemical bomb, stick of pyronite, or other device that can be triggered by a fuse. Alternately, you can attach one fuse to another to extend its burn time by 1 round.

Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You light the alchemical fuse with an adjacent fire source or a fire source that you hold in a hand. If you have a tindertwig in your other hand, you can activate the tindertwig and use it to light a fuse with the same Interact action. A lit fuse takes 1 round per attached fuse to burn down. During the round that the fuse runs out, the device to which the fuse has been attached explodes or otherwise activates at the end of your turn. For a bomb, this deals splash damage, and for pyronite, it deals pyronite's normal damage. An alchemical fuse burns underwater or in up to moderate wind.

Activate [one-action] Interact; Effect You extinguish the fuse

## Alchemical Gauntlet

Item 1

Alchemical

Source Treasure Vault pg. 621.1

Price 10 gp

An alchemical gauntlet emits small alchemical detonations when it makes contact with a foe. As an Interact action, you can place a bomb into a metal bracket near the wrist of the gauntlet. The bomb must be one that deals energy damage, such as an acid flask, alchemist's fire, bottled lightning, frost vial, or thunderstone. The next three attacks made with the gauntlet deal 1d4 damage of the bomb's damage type in addition to the gauntlet's normal damage. If the second and third attacks aren't all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb's energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and aren't modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb's effect.

This glass sphere is divided into four quarters, each of which contains a different material aligned with good, evil, chaos, or law, such as shavings from a holy relic or dried flowers that grew near a planar rift to the Abyss. When an alignment ampoule strikes a creature with a weakness to good, evil, chaos, or law, it deals the listed damage, which matches the creature's highest weakness. This damage is always based on the weaknesses of the initial target of the attack. If a creature has multiple eligible weaknesses, randomly determine the damage type. An alignment ampoule has no effect against creatures that don't have a weakness to the ampoule's associated alignment types.

This elixir is usually stored in a small metal flask or miniature stein. The dark liquid sparkles as if it were full of stars and is considered sacred to Cayden Cailean and to the cults of the Failed in Absalom. The next time you would die from damage within 8 hours after you drink the ambrosia, it prevents you from dying, you regain 20 Hit Points, the elixir's benefits end, and you become temporarily immune to the ambrosia of undying hope for 24 hours. The ambrosia can't protect you from death effects or disintegration, but it can protect against almost any other form of death via damage. You can only be under the effect of a single ambrosia of undying hope at a time.

## Animal Repellent

Item 1+

Consumable

Olfactory

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Usage held in 1 hand

Bulk L

Activate

1 minute (Interact)

Animal repellent is a noxious alchemical substance that makes you repulsive to a certain kind of animal. You can, for example, make ape repellent, bear repellent, or snake repellent, but not a repellent that affects all animals. The repellent doesn't work on creatures that are similar to the kind of animal, but not actually animals—for example, bear repellent wouldn't work on werebears. Animal repellent is ineffective against animals with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher, such as awakened animals. When you initially learn the formula for animal repellent, you learn the formulas for all common animals. If no animals of a kind are common, such as sea serpents, you must learn the formula for that kind separately, and it has the same rarity as the least-rare creature of that kind.

You Activate animal repellent by sprinkling it on yourself or a creature within reach, or by spreading it on a surface in an area up to 10 feet square. The repellent lasts for 24 hours or until scrubbed clean with 1 minute of work (consisting of multiple Interact actions). The designated kind of animal can smell the repellent from three times as far away as normal.

The designated kind of creature typically avoids the coated creature or area, which smells foul and feels unnerving to it. If in combat or otherwise distressed, the creature can approach within 20 feet of the affected creature or area only if it succeeds at a Will save with a DC determined by the type of animal repellent. Once it succeeds at this save, the animal is temporarily immune for 1 minute. If the animal attacks in a way that causes it to taste or ingest the repellent, it must succeed at a Fortitude save at the listed DC or become sickened 1 (or sickened 2 on a critical failure).

This dried herb is known for its ability to draw toxins from the body, albeit violently. You can administer the suspension orally, Activating the item as part of the same activity you use to Treat Poison. If you succeed at your Medicine check to Treat Poison against an ingested poison, you can reduce the stage of the toxin by one stage, though this can't reduce the stage below stage 1 or cure the poison entirely. If you do, the creature becomes sickened 2 as its body purges the toxin. An artevil suspension doesn't work unless the poison was administered through ingestion; for instance, if a poison can be administered through either ingestion or injury and was administered through injury, the suspension won't work.

Assassin vine wine that has been aged for several years— or artificially aged with alchemy—develops both a greater complexity of flavor and a stronger connection to an assassin vine's bond with nature. When you drink the wine, vegetation in a 20-foot emanation around you begins to writhe, becoming difficult terrain until the start of your next turn.

This vial of murky, acrid-smelling liquid is derived from a blend of strange blood, typically coming from aberrations and cryptids. It has no special properties when used alone, but if you drink one shortly before drinking an alchemical elixir, you enhance the elixir's duration. Many tales of mysterious cryptids are actually based on encounters with people suffering the aftereffects of such concoctions.

After drinking a baleblood draft, the next elixir you drink within 1 minute that has a duration of at least 1 minute and at most 1 hour has its duration extended by 50% (so a lesser cheetah's elixir lasts for a minute and a half instead of 1 minute).

However, after pairing baleblood draft with another elixir, you suffer an eerie side effect for 1 week. This side effect never causes serious harm, although it might be inconvenient and is always ominous in appearance. All elixirs made in the same batch cause the same side effect. Drinking another draft with the same side effect extends the side effect's duration by another week, and drinking one with a different side effect causes you to suffer both effects simultaneously.

Source Guns & Gears pg. 169

Price 1 cp

The smallest unit of black powder that still has a simple use, a dose can be a simple package paper parcel around black powder or it can be packaged with a metal bullet or pellet to be used as ammunition. When ignited with a fuse or exposed to direct flame, a dose of black powder explodes. This isn't powerful enough to deal damage but makes a loud sound and could trigger further explosions. A fuse for a dose can be created with a few twists of paper and causes the dose to explode the round after it's lit.

## Black Powder (Horn)

Item 2

Source Guns & Gears pg. 169

Price 5 gp

A horn contains 500 doses worth of black powder. A horn can be detonated by leaving a small trail of black powder and then lighting it. Each 5-foot square requires one dose of black powder to create a trail through. As long as the horn is mostly full (at least 400 doses remaining) it can be detonated to deal 1d6 fire damage in a 5-foot burst (DC 16 basic Reflex save). It takes 1 round per 15 feet of powder trail laid down for a horn to detonate after the trail is lit. If multiple horns detonate simultaneously, it can increase the area of the explosion, but the damage in overlapping areas doesn't increase.

Detonating multiple kegs can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect; detonating a keg and any horns at the same time in an overlapping area also doesn't increase the damage.

This small silver tin is filled with a herb-infused salve and a shroud of fine silk fabric. The salve smells of lavender and hyssop and is waxy to the touch. The shroud, made of spun silk, can a hold a Medium or smaller creature. If you apply the salve and shroud to a creature that died within the past 3 days, a process which normally takes 1 hour, it slows the decomposition process, allowing a creature to be brought back to life with raise dead up to 1 week after its death.

This suit of bone-based fortress plate is a masterpiece of alchemical science. This armor has a receiver that can hold a single lodestone bomb, which takes 3 Interact actions to install. A loaded suit of bone dreadnought plate can be activated to cause the bomb to shift numerous small plates and hinges, offering a wide variety of protections, granting you resistance to cold, electricity, fire, piercing, and slashing damage equal to the loaded lodestone bomb's splash damage. These effects last for 20 minutes, but each time you're hit by an attack that deals damage of one of these types, decrease the remaining duration by 1 minute. Once activated, the armor can't be deactivated. The armor uses up the lodestone bomb during the duration and can't be activated again until a new one is installed.

This concoction mixes into a thick, paste-like substance when shaken. When exposed to air, the substance dries after one minute. If poured over a book, scroll, or other material featuring words written in ink, the brew will make an exact copy of the words it is in contact with while it dries, though it doesn't contain any magical effect or other special properties of the original words.

When applied to a creature, the repellent causes cave worms of the indicated type to avoid attacking that creature in melee as long as they have something else nearby to attack. The repellent does not deter a cave worm from making ranged attacks against a coated target. If no creatures are within a cave worm's reach and it wants to approach and make a melee attack, it approaches and attacks a non-coated creature if it can without spending more actions to do so.

Ifthe coated creature is swallowed by the designated type of cave worm, the cave worm must succeed at a Fortitude save or involuntarily regurgitate the swallowed creature on the next round (a single action).

When sprinkled around an area, cave worm repellent negates any chance of a random encounter with the particular type of cave worm in that area, as the creatures purposefully avoid the affected area.

Other types of repellent that function similarly to this one might exist at the GM's discretion. Uncommon or rare creatures are typically much harder to repel, and repellent against them might ne

The contraption called cold comfort is a watertight pouch filled with a handful of small, heavy, silvery pellets. When emptied into an adjacent body of water, the pellets freeze the water's surface almost instantly, creating an ice block in a 10-foot square to a depth of 1 foot. Any creatures inside this space must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 cold damage and is immobilized for 1 minute or until it Escapes (DC 20) or the ice is broken. The entire ice block has AC 10, Hardness 10, and 40 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits, cold damage, and precision damage. The ice is strong enough to support one Large creature or up to four Medium or Small creatures. Traversing the slippery ice requires a successful DC 20 Acrobatics check to Balance.

You can pour a vial of this dark liquid onto one melee weapon, one thrown weapon, or 10 pieces of ammunition. When used on a melee or thrown weapon, rather than ammunition, the blanch lasts for the listed duration or 10 successful Strikes, whichever comes first. When you use it on ammunition, the blanch is expended on a given piece of ammunition after firing it, whether it hits or not. A cold iron blanch contains small amounts of alchemist's fire, so it must be used all at once; an opened vial ignites to melt the cold iron onto the weapon and is quickly consumed. The weapon or ammunition counts as cold iron instead of its normal precious material (such as silver) for any physical damage it deals, if applicable.

These coatings come in different colors, each with a different special effect. A bottle of colorful coating contains enough to slather over one 5-foot square within your reach or space and is made with a special dispenser that enables you to coat the surface using only one hand. It's possible to use the coating on any surface that can be painted (subject to the GM's discretion). Colorful coating dries instantly, and its effect in the square you coated lasts for 1 minute. After that time, the coating turns to fine, inert powder, returning the square to its original condition unless otherwise noted.

## Colorful Coating (Blue)

Item 3

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Price 8 gp

Bulk L

Blue colorful coating contains bonding compounds that firm up a surface, making it more stable and more supportive of weight. When applied to material that's loose or unstable, the square can hold twice as much weight before giving way. The coating also slows any collapse, making it easier to avoid and granting a +1 circumstance bonus to Reflex saving throws in reaction to the coated surface's collapse.

This coating can shore up a wall, ceiling, door, or similar opening, granting a +2 circumstance bonus to the DC for Athletics checks to Force Open the coated surface.

## Colorful Coating (Green)

Item 3

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Price 10 gp

Bulk L

Green colorful coating dries into a low-friction surface. It makes the square slippery, making it both difficult terrain and uneven ground with a DC to Balance of 20. A creature that Steps or Crawls doesn't have to attempt to Balance.

The coating also makes a coated wall or ceiling harder to climb. It imposes a +2 circumstance penalty to checks to Climb the coated surface.

Yellow colorful coating and green colorful coating have opposite effects. If they're both applied to the same surface, they negate one another.

## Colorful Coating (Indigo)

Indigo colorful coating contains agents that destroy weaker objects. When applied to a surface or object, the coating treats the object's Hardness as 2 lower and deals 1d4 acid damage to the object each round. The damage this coating deals remains after the coating becomes inert.

## Colorful Coating (Orange)

Item 3

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Price 12 gp

Bulk L

Orange colorful coating contains a mixture of acidic substances. As it dries, caustic ingredients rise to the coating's surface. The square becomes hazardous terrain, dealing 1d4 acid damage to any creature that moves through it. A creature can take this acid damage only once per round.

## Colorful Coating (Red)

Item 3

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Price 10 gp

Bulk L

Red colorful coating contains rubbery compounds, turning any surface it covers into a trampoline. A creature or object that falls onto a square coated with red colorful coating takes no falling damage and bounces half again as high as the original fall. If the creature fell straight down, then with several bounces, it comes safely to a stop. If it was moving horizontally, its bounce continues in the same direction, with a distance determined by the GM. If the coating is on a wall, a creature pushed or Shoved into the wall bounces back half again as far and avoids taking any damage from being pushed into the wall. On a ceiling, red colorful coating is useful only in unusual circumstances, such as reverse gravity.

## Colorful Coating (Violet)

Item 4

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Price 15 gp

Bulk L

Violet colorful coating contains compounds that become goopy and sticky. A square of this coating is difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the square must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take a –15-foot penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn. On a critical failure, the creature is immobilized in the square until the end of its next turn. The target can end these effects by Escaping (DC 20) or spending 2 Interact actions to remove the sticky substances. These Interact actions don't have to be consecutive, and other creatures can help by providing the actions.

## Colorful Coating (Yellow)

Item 3

Source Treasure Vault pg. 521.1

Price 8 gp

Bulk L

Yellow colorful coating contains a variety of compounds that fill small gaps and harden into a flat surface that increases friction, making it much easier to move on the square's surface. On the affected surface, the coating reduces difficult terrain caused by slipperiness, such as from ice or grease; this eliminates difficult terrain, reduces greater difficult terrain to difficult terrain, and reduces uneven ground to greater difficult terrain. The coating can't affect difficult terrain caused by features or effects not part of the surface, such as crowds, underbrush, wind, magic, and so on. The GM determines if yellow colorful coating can affect a surface's terrain.

The coating also makes a coated wall or ceiling easier to climb. It provides a +2 circumstance bonus to checks to Climb the coated surface.

[two-actions]

Strike

Condensed mana is a crystal vial filled with concentrated miasma from the Mana Wastes. The colors shift abruptly and unpredictably within and the opening of the bottle is sealed tighter than any other potion or alchemical item, emphasizing its dangers.

On a successful Strike, the creature takes 1 force damage. Then, roll on the Wellspring Surge table. The result affects all creatures within the emanation indiscriminately. For the purpose of determining the effects of the surge, use a spell level of 4 and a DC of 23. The person Striking with this vial is considered to be the caster for the purposes of determining effects on the Mana Surge table. The emanation is centered on the target's space, and both the caster and the target of the wellspring surge are the target of the condensed mana. On a failed Strike, the surge only has an effect if it would normally affect an area; if you roll an effect that depends on a caster or a target, nothing happens. If the effect normally doesn't have a DC, creatures affected by the surge or within the surge's area must attempt a DC 23 Reflex save instead. On a critical failure on any saving throw against condensed mana, the creature is stunned 1 by the wild energies of the surge.

Sometimes a wellspring surge's effects make it difficult to determine exactly who is affected. The GM makes the determination, basing it on creatures directly affected; for example, while many creatures can hear the music from the surge “strike up the band,” only the creature emanating the music is directly affected by it.

Craft Requirements You must be in or adjacent to an area of Mana Wastes miasma.

Jubilost invented feyfoul accidentally while he was attempting to create a cologne that would enhance its wearer's appearance to make them seem more otherworldly, but to anyone that asks, the gnome alchemist quickly claims that he'd always intended to create an alchemical tool that provided protection from fey magic.

A single dose of feyfoul spritzed on a person in the manner of perfume grants the wearer an item bonus to Will saving throws against mental effects generated by fey creatures.

You apply the oil to the target you want to bind, which must be within 10 feet of you. After the oil is applied, at the end of any round during which the target took an action with the attack, manipulate, or move trait, it must attempt a Fortitude save against a DC determined by the oil's type. A mechanism that's slowed 2 or more by gearbinder oil also can't use reactions. Gearbinder oil functions for up to 6 rounds before becoming an inert, oily residue.

Healing vapor is a substance that accelerates natural recovery processes by dispersing a mist infused with a variety of reagents typically used for healing and recovery. When deployed from a sealed container, the vapors fill a 5-foot burst, last for 10 minutes, and can affect up to four living creatures at one time. Any creatures beyond the first four gain no benefit, though if a creature leaves before the duration is over, a new creature that enters can benefit from the mist. A creature benefiting from the vapors regains a number of Hit Points based on the vapor's type. While affected, a creature also gains an item bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons. If the areas of more than one healing vapor overlap, only the strongest applies to creatures inside overlapping areas. Strong wind disperses the mist, rendering it ineffective while the wind blows.

Sealed in a packet so it can be released in a pressurized puff, implosion dust causes amorphous creatures to compress and shrink by hardening and even evaporating the liquid components of their physical forms. It's effective at weakening water elementals, air elementals, ooze, and other creatures the GM determines are similarly amorphous, which can even include particularly gelatinous aberrations. You release the dust toward one creature within 5 feet of you, which must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. Implosion dust functions for up to 6 rounds. It then becomes inert, and the creature returns to its normal size.

Critical Success The dust becomes inert, and the creature returns to its normal size.

Success The target increases in size one step, up to its normal size. If it's at its normal size after the increase, the effect ends.

Failure The target decreases in size one step, to a minimum of Tiny. The reach of each of its Strikes decreases by 5 feet, to a minimum of 5 feet if the creature is Small or larger, or a minimum of 0 feet if the creature is Tiny. Shrinking also imposes a status penalty to the creature's physical melee damage. This penalty is –2 for every step lower than its normal size the creature is.

Critical Failure As failure, but the target decreases in size by two steps.

Favored by spies and tricksters, an infiltrator’s elixir is used to alter your appearance. When imbibed, you take the shape of a humanoid creature of your size, but different enough so you might be unrecognizable. If you aren’t a humanoid, you might take on a form more similar to your own, at the GM’s discretion.

The creator of the elixir decides the basics of the appearance you transform into when you imbibe the elixir, including eye color, skin tone, and hair color. The elixir can’t change your form into that of a specific person. After the form takes hold, you retain it for the next 10 minutes.

This ink, derived from inks used by lovers to deliver secret messages, dries to a color similar to most parchments. Avarneus's version requires another dose of lover's ink and a specific agitation to reveal the hidden message, preventing casual interception. Any message written with lovers' ink is revealed by applying a page worth of lover's ink and vigorously shaking, requiring 3 Interact actions. A typical vial provides enough ink to fill 1 page worth of text. While the text is hidden, a creature closely examining a surface marked with lover's ink can detect the presence of the ink with a successful DC 25 Perception check. On a critical success, they can make out the ink well enough to use Society to Decipher Writing.

This translucent yellow-green liquid has a sharp, tangy odor and an oily sheen. It's mildly acidic and can cause a minor rash after prolonged contact with skin. To unlock its true potential, you must submerge a piece of an intelligent creature's brain matter in the acid and allow the material to completely dissolve. This takes 2d10 minutes, during which time the mnemonic acid bubbles and steams eagerly.

Once the brain matter fully dissolves, you can consume the acid as an Interact action to experience a powerful vision and relive one of the memories of the creature whose brain matter was dissolved. You have no control over which memory you experience, although such visions are almost always of memories that were meaningful to the owner of the dissolved brain matter. The memory might be of a single event or a series of related and interconnected events; the memory lasts no longer than 10 minutes, and you're blind to the world around you for the duration.

Each dose of mnemonic acid requires roughly 10% of the brain matter of the creature whose visions are to be experienced, meaning that up to 10 different memories from the same creature can be experienced, each with a different dose of mnemonic acid, before the brain matter is exhausted.

An alchemist with the Craft Philosopher's Stone feat can create a philosopher's stone once per month by spending 1 batch of infused reagents during their daily preparations using the advanced alchemy class feature. This is the only way to create a philosopher's stone.

At a glance, a philosopher's stone appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of natural rock. Breaking the rock open with a Force Open action (DC 35) reveals a cavity at the stone's heart. The cavity is lined with a rare type of quicksilver that can transmute base metals into precious metals or create an elixir of rejuvenation.

To use the quicksilver, you must be legendary in Crafting and have the Alchemical Crafting feat. You can then use the stone's quicksilver for one of two effects:

You can apply the stone's quicksilver to an infused true elixir of life using an Interact action. This turns the elixir into an infused elixir of rejuvenation instantaneously. This doesn't require any crafting time or additional materials.

You can spend up to a month of downtime applying the quicksilver either to iron to create silver or to lead to create gold.

Usage held in 1 hand

A stick of pyronite is a devastating explosive that fills an area with fire and concussive force when it detonates— as long as its fuse has been lit!

Pyronite is an unstable material with a limited shelf life. Sticks of pyronite must be kept dry and cool; otherwise, the raw pyronite will leak out of the rods and collect as a semi-transparent goo that explodes on any impact or loud noise, with an explosive effect equal to half the number of rods.

Activate [one-action] or [two-actions] Interact; Effect Activating a stick of pyronite is usually a two-action activity. First, you interact with the pyronite to light its fuse with a source of fire. This fire source can be an object you hold in another hand, such as a tindertwig or a lit torch, or it can be a free-standing adjacent fire. Once the fuse is lit, you throw it (an Interact action with the ranged trait) up to 50 feet away—if you hurl it into an existing fire, you don't need to take the initial action to light its fuse and can Activate the pyronite with only one action. You can toss the pyronite anywhere within 50 feet, though at the GM's discretion, you might need to make an attack roll if the throw is unusually challenging. Once a stick of pyronite's fuse is lit, it explodes at the end of your turn, regardless of whether you've thrown it or not. (A lit fuse can be extinguished with an Interact action.) If multiple sticks of pyronite detonate at the end of your turn, you can increase the area, but not the damage, of this effect. When the pyronite explodes, all creatures in a 20-foot burst must attempt a DC 28 Reflex save or take 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

Critical Success The creature is unaffected.

Success The creature takes half damage and is deafened for 1 round.

Quickpatch glue is a fast-setting adhesive designed for rapid but temporary repairs. When applied to a broken item, the glue adheres the item's pieces back together. This does not restore the item's hit points, but it allows the item to be used for its normal function and removes the broken condition. The glue is fragile and degrades over time. An item repaired by quickpatch glue regains the broken condition after it takes damage or 1 hour passes (whichever comes first). In order to apply a new vial of quickpatch glue to or repair the item, the item's holder must first remove the glue residue, a process that requires 10 minutes of effort and a set of alchemist's tools.

Skunk bombs are made from the concentrated odors of xulgaths, hezrous, and other creatures with natural or supernatural stench. The bomb grants an item bonus to attack rolls and deals poison damage and poison splash damage. Any creature hit by the bomb or in its splash area must attempt a Fortitude saving throw with a DC based on the bomb's type. Creatures in the splash area treat the results of their saving throw as one step better.

Critical Success The target is unaffected.

Success The target is sickened 1.

Failure The target is sickened 1 and slowed 1 while sickened.

Critical Failure The target is blinded for 1 round, sickened 2, and slowed 1 while sickened.

Creatures sickened by the bomb emit an odor that lasts 10 minutes after the sickened condition ends (or 1 hour if they were also blinded). The odor can be removed or neutralized by using prestidigitation or similar magic or by spending 10 minutes scrubbing with ample soap and water. While the odor lasts, creatures within 30 feet can smell the target, enabling even those with a weak sense of smell to detect its presence, and all creatures gain a +1 item bonus to Track the affected creature for as long as it has the odor. A creature that has imprecise or precise scent doubles the range at which it can detect the target using this scent.

When you drink this elixir, you physically become as you were in whatever phase of your youth you desire. Your new body begins in peak health, regardless of what your actual condition was at that age. Any physical or mental imperfections— including scars, lost limbs, and curses, diseases, poisons of 20th level or lower— are removed, and you regain your full Hit Points. You immediately begin to age normally again, with your natural lifespan extended as if you had never aged past your new apparent age. You retain all your memories.

Unlike Crafting most items, brewing the sun orchid elixir takes 1 month’s time. While an individual vial of sun orchid elixir isn’t unique, the formula is unique, and it’s known only to Artokus Kirran of Thuvia.

This quilt is defined by its green lily-pad pattern, which is rare in Bellflower communications. The quilt is 10 feet square and infused with a reagent that activates when the quilt is laid out across soil or earth. One round after you lay out the quilt, the ground beneath it becomes soft and muddy, creating difficult terrain in the area where the quilt was. You can leave the quilt to maintain the difficult terrain indefinitely, but the affected ground begins to dry once you remove the quilt with an Interact action. The ground dries over the span of 1 hour, after which the ground returns to normal terrain. Placing the quilt on the ground uses up its infused reagents, and it becomes an ordinary quilt once removed from the ground.

The water changes color, as seen on the table, or remains clear if it doesn't detect any traces of undead. The higher the undead's level or number of undead in contact with the sample, the more intense the color. This isn't a foolproof way to identify a disguised creature as undead, since any contact with undead causes the sample to change colors. If an undead has been disguising its undead nature or its presence in an area, the GM can roll a secret DC 20 Deception or Stealth check for the creature when the dye is activated. On a success, the creature avoided leaving traces. This can't protect the undead from discovery if it actively uses its undead abilities on an area or creature, though it can attempt to remove any evidence with activities like Cover Tracks and Conceal an Object.

A malformed, artificial brain pulses with alchemical life inside a nutrient-rich vat. When the vat-grown brain is activated, it attempts to counteract one condition of your choice that was gained from an ability with the mental trait, which it does by drawing the negative mental impressions into itself. However, the artificial brain is not robust, and the strain of the transfer quickly destroys it. The vat-grown brain has a counteract level of 5 and a +17 modifier on the roll.

In addition, any arthropods (insects, spiders, scorpions, crabs, and similar invertebrate animals) must attempt a Will save when attempting to attack you with a melee Strike, or with a swarm attack such as the spider swarm's swarming bites. The arthropod then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.

Upon drinking this mutagen, you can feel your blood surge through your body and hear a low-pitched humming in your ears. These sensations subside as the flesh and muscles of your arm loosen and stretch, the fibers of your very being reaching out to combine with the base of one melee weapon you're holding.

Benefit Choose one melee weapon you're holding in one or both hands. You gain the listed item bonus to your attack rolls with this weapon and to Will saves against fear effects. Any attempt to Disarm or otherwise remove the weapon from your hands must exceed the listed DC based on the type of war blood mutagen or the attempt fails.

Drawback You can't voluntarily remove the weapon unless you succeed at an Athletics check at the listed DC, which ends the war blood mutagen's effects; this check takes a single action. If you perform an action with the concentrate trait, you must succeed at a DC 5 flat check or the action is lost.

This bladder of water explodes when put under pressure or upon being punctured, dealing minimal damage, neutralizing acids, and dousing flames. A water bomb deals the listed bludgeoning damage and bludgeoning splash damage. On a hit, if the target is suffering from persistent acid or persistent fire damage, it can attempt a flat check to end that persistent damage immediately. As this is particularly effective assistance, the DC of the flat check is reduced from 15 to 10 for this check. On a hit against an unattended, non-magical fire, the bomb extinguishes the fire, or extinguishes one square of fire for a larger fire. Many types grant an item bonus to attack rolls, and some types extinguish wider areas of fire.

[one-action]

Interact

This set of tubing snakes down the striking surface of a weapon to deliver alchemical explosives. A single lesser alchemical bomb can be fitted to the weapon siphon as an Interact action. The bomb must be one that deals energy damage, such as an acid flask, alchemist's fire, bottled lightning, frost vial, or thunderstone. The next three attacks made with the weapon deal 1d4 damage of the bomb's damage type in addition to the weapon's normal damage. If the second and third attacks aren't all made within 1 minute of the first attack, the bomb's energy is wasted. These attacks never deal splash damage or other special effects of the bomb and aren't modified by any abilities that add to or modify a bomb's effect.

Adding a weapon siphon to a weapon throws off its balance, causing the multiple attack penalty with the weapon to be one greater than usual (usually –6 on a second attack and –11 on a third; or –5 and –10 with an agile weapon).

Taking a bite makes you feel warm.
