Description: You conjure a low cobblestone wall along the ground, a perfect source of cover, at a point you can see within range. The wall is 18 inches thick and is composed of three 5-foot long by 3-foot high segments. Each segment must be contiguous with at least one other segment. A Medium creature that hunkers behind the wall has half cover from ranged attacks and a Small creature that hunkers behind it has three-quarters cover from ranged attacks. A prone creature has full cover behind the wall. The wall can be leapt over without using any additional movement. Each segment has AC 10 and 60 hit points. Reducing a segment of the wall to 0 hit points causes it to crumble, destroying it. The wall disappears when all the segments are destroyed or the spell ends.
