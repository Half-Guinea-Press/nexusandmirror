Description: Choose a Large or smaller creature on the ground within range. The earth opens up beneath that creature and attempts to swallow them up. The target must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained for the duration. Furthermore, if the target fails the save, it begins sinking into the ground.A restrained target or another creature within 5 feet of it can attempt to free the target by using an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing the target. The target has disadvantage on this Strength check. The spell ends early if the target is freed. At the end of the targetâ€™s turn, it sinks deeper into the ground. A Small or smaller creature fully sinks into the ground after 2 rounds of sinking, a Medium creature fully sinks after 3 rounds, and a Large creature fully sinks after 4 rounds. If a target fully sinks underground, it begins to suffocate.
