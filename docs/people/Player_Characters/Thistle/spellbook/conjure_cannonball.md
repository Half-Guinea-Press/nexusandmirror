On a hit, the target takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes half as much damage as the target.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each spell slot above 3rd.
