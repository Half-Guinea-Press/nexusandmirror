# Earth-Shattering Kaboom

4th-level evocation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a red button)<br>
Duration: 1 round

Description: Streams of arcane energy pour from your hands and coalesce into a great unstable ball at a point you can see within range. At the end of this spell's duration, when the mass of arcane energy is at its zenith, you rupture the ball of energy, causing a massive detonation. When this happens, roll a d20. On a 1, the ball fizzles into nothingness. On any other roll, each creature in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 thunder damage plus 5d8 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the thunder damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
