3rd-level transmutation (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous

Description: This spell repairs breaks, tears, and other damage in an object you can see within range, such as a smashed control panel, ripped radiation plating, a corrupted keycard, or a jammed turbine. As long as the damaged object is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage and restoring it to full working order. Note that this spell can't restore lost hit points to a damaged ship. This spell can repair a magic item or construct as long as the object's magic was present at the time it was broken. The spell does not, however, restore lost charges.
