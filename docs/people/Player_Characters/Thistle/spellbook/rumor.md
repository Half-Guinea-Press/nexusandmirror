# Rumor

1st-level enchantment (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self (100-foot radius)<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 1 minute

Description: You magically spread a rumor of 10 words or less. Any intelligent creature within range that is near three or more other creatures which speak the same language as them believes that they hear the rumor being repeated by someone nearby. Different creatures hear the rumor from different people, so a concrete origin point is impossible to discern. Generally, creatures will not be outright hostile upon hearing even the most vicious rumors, but hearing a rumor can affect their disposition positively or negatively.
