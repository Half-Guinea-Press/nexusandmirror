Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Self<br>
Components: V, S, M (the tip of an octopus tentacle)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Description: You sprout grotesque, whipping tendrils which automatically attack nearby creatures. When a creature comes within 5 feet of you or begins its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st, up to a maximum of 6d6.
