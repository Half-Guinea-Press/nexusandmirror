# Create Vacuum

3rd-level conjuration<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a bit of kindling)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Description: You create a spherical area nearly devoid of air centered on a point within range for the duration. The sphere can have any radius you choose, up to a maximum of 30 feet. Any creature in the area that breathes air must hold its breath or begin suffocating. If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the sphere is centered on the object and moves with it. Airborne substances such as poisonous gas, smoke, or fog can't enter the sphere, and any such substances already within the sphere's area are destroyed. If such a substance is created by a spell of a higher level than this one, it is unaffected.
