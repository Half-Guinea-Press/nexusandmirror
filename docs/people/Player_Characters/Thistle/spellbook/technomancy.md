Description: With a complex input gesture, you can manipulate a technological device you can see within range. You can use this ability to perform any basic operation on the device, including, but not limited to, pressing an external button, entering a dozen keystrokes of data, performing an authorized operation (such as opening an unlocked door), dimming or brightening a screen, or muting a device that has a speaker. You canâ€™t disconnect or reconnect wires, or perform an unauthorized operation, such as crashing a device or changing its password without knowing the original.
