# Time's Arrow

1st-level transmutation (chronomancy)<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Components: V, S, M (a physical missile weighing a pound or less, such as an arrow, bolt, or sling bullet)<br>
Duration: 1 hour

Description: This spell enchants a missile so that it freezes in time and space. You may reposition the missile as part of the action to cast the spell. The missile remains frozen in place until either a creature passes within 120 feet in front of it, something touches it, a strong wind blows upon it, the enchantment is dispelled or the duration ends. At that point, the missile moves suddenly, as if it was just fired or thrown with a range of 120 feet. If a creature is in the line of fire, the missile makes an attack which adds your spell attack bonus to the attack roll, and does the basic damage of whatever missile type was used (missiles that vary by launcher use the highest possible damage dice)
