Description: You channel a wave of arcane power into your fingertips, but recycle the leftover energy into a new spell slot. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 force damage. Whether you hit or miss, you then regain one expended 1st-level spell slot.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th level spell slot, you instead regain an expended 2nd level spell slot. If you cast it using a 9th level spell slot, you instead regain an expended 3rd level spell slot.
