Pixie Traits
As a Pixie your character is blessed with special attributes,
that set it apart from other creatures
Age. Pixies age very slowly, if at all. They are created
fully formed, physically and mentally, taking on the
appearance of a beautiful human of the age of 10 to 30
with pointed ears.
Alignment. Pixies are as wild like the elements of
nature they were created from, but also know that nature
has rules that it follows. As such the fey are often neutral
on the lawful-chaos spectrum, tho some do go to the ends
of it sometimes. Protecting nature and its freedom is of
utmost importance to pixies, much like other fey, and they
are more often good than not.
Size. In Pixie form pixie sizes ranging from 3 to 5 inches
in sprite form. In giant form they are 12 times this size,
going from 3 to 5 inches to 3 to 5 feet tall. Your size is tiny
as a Pixies and medium as a giant.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 15 feet, and your
base flying speed is 40 feet in pixie form, 30 feet walking
and 25 flying in giant form.
Transformation. pixies have the ability to change
between their sprite and giant forms at will, with use of an
action. Both forms have their pros and cons however
Pixie form is the most well known form. Pixies have the
ability to fly and are able to dash through the air the same
as when walking in giant form. This ability makes pixies
extremely mobile, but it has its cons as well. When in Pixie
form, pixies are unable to use any attacks, or spells due to
their small size. Flying vertically counts as difficult terrain.
In giant form pixies are able to use their normal attacks
and spells as any other humanoid can, and gain a faster
walking speed.
Fey Creature. You are immune to being charmed, and
can't be put to sleep by magic. You have 60 ft Darkvision
and 60 ft Truesight
Languages. You can speak, read, and write common
and sylvan. Sylvan is an old language, being the root of
elvish. The language is most commonly known for being
used in spell incantations, and it is said that one can
become entranced by its beauty and fluidity.

Ignan
Those created from flames have explosively unstable
personalities. They are often times the most problematic,
due to their short fuses, but Ignan are highly valuable
allies. What these flaming Pixies lack in predictability, they
make up for in their ability to channel magical forces,
making them powerful sorcerers.
Ignan elemental colors are vibrant oranges and reds.
Their shimmering hair is short and forms into whispy
shimmering locks, causing it to resemble actual fire. Their
wings resemble autumn leaves, and have even length to
width proportions.
Ability Score Increase. Your charisma score is
increased by 2 and your intelligence score is increased by
1
Burning Spirit. You are resistant to fire damage.
Pyromancy. You know the Firebolt cantrip, charisma is
your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.

Exile
Sometimes seen as a fate worse than death, exile has 
long been a popular sanction for radicals, dissidents, 
and troublemakers. Exiling these people allows the 
authorities to remove a thorn from their sides without 
creating a martyr or having to keep the unwanted person 
in costly perpetual captivity. Many a coup or revolution 
has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime 
being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or 
neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the 
‘verse.
 On occasion, a person may choose exile voluntarily, 
either as an alternative to something worse or because 
they desire time on the Frontier to grow and develop. An 
exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures 
and contact émigré communities while rallying support 
remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that 
aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue 
otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of 
more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the 
impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.
 Exiles take to adventuring for a number of reasons. 
For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they 
seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while 
others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to 
be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some 
exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world 
with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all, 
however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere, 
with no choice other than to continue wandering forever.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival
Languages: Any two of your choice
Equipment: A dagger, a small strongbox, a memento 
from your homeland, a set of common clothes, and a 
pouch containing 5 gp
Feature: Exile Network
You keep in touch with a network of exiles and 
expatriates, who possess an eclectic mix of skills and the 
durable spirit of pioneers. If you need to find someone 
with an unusual or specialized skill (such as art forgery, 
translation of ancient languages, or poison-brewing), you 
likely know where to find them.
Variant Feature: Radical Sympathizers
As a prominent figurehead for a group of religious, 
political, or ethnic radicals, you are often able to find 
people who sympathize with your situation. When you 
employ hirelings, they may offer you better rates, fanatical 
loyalty, or enhanced services.
Reason for Exile
You were exiled for a reason. Choose a ‘crime’ or roll on 
the table below to determine why you were forced to leave 
your home.
d10 Crime
1 Opposition to political rulers
2 Tax exile
3 Religious dissent/radicalism
4 Sentenced to exile for serious crime
5 Death sentence commuted to exile after 
committing capital crime
6 Forbidden love
7 Refugee displaced by war or disaster
8 Escaping shameful failures committed at home
9 Fleeing false accusations
10 Self-imposed exile/journey of self-discovery
Suggested Characteristics 
Being exiled is a deeply painful experience, and life as 
a stateless persona non grata is extremely challenging. 
Such a trial is sure to leave some marks on the exile’s 
personality.
d8 Personality Trait

3 Hand-written letters are my preferred means of 
communication.

5 I sometimes become pensive and withdrawn.
6 I have a lot of interesting and unusual friends.
7 I often reminisce about my years before exile.
8 I write a lot of poetry in my spare time.
d6 Ideal

day. (Any)
2 Liberty. I will live the way I want to! (Chaotic)
3 Peace. I will make the most of my time in exile, 
living a peaceable life. (Lawful)
4 Leadership. It is on me to lead my people through 
the wilderness. (Good)
5 Revenge. I must take revenge on those who cast me 
out! (Evil)
6 Refuge. In these dangerous times, I must focus 
solely on survival. (Neutral)
d6 Bond
1 I have made many good friends in the émigré 
community.

end up ranting against my opponents.
2 I get in trouble with the law wherever I go.
3 I can’t seem to put down roots or form lasting 
connections anywhere.
4 My hatred for the people who exiled me sometimes 
crowds out reason in my head.
5 I prefer to work alone, and rarely seek compromise 
with others.
6 I’ve been away so long, I have lost touch with my 
family/culture/language.


# School of Automata
Inspired by the practicality of gadgeteers, wizards in the School of Automata depart from the traditional realm of scholarly book-smart mages in favor of a hands-on, mechanical approach to their magic. These so-called mechamancers use their expertise in mechanist's tools, engineering, and the principles of magical technology to animate obedient automatons to follow their every command. Typically, mechamancers reside some distance away from the dangers of exploring, while their creations engage in the unpleasantness of combat on their behalf.
## Bonus Proficiencies
Starting when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Technology skill and mechanist's tools. 
## Engineering Savant
Beginning at 2nd level, you can fashion and animate constructs that serve at your command. When you prepare spells following a long rest, you use your mechanist's tools and spend spell slots to raise a collection of mundane parts into mechanical constructs. Once you have expended a spell slot to make a construct, you can't regain that slot until the construct is disassembled (requiring 10 minutes of work) or drops to 0 hit points. Different constructs cost different number of spell slot levels and can only be created when you have enough levels in this class, as shown on the Constructs table above. You can expend one or more spell slots to create each construct, as long as you meet or exceed the number of slot levels required. You can have up to 3 constructs at one time.
 When you take a long rest, you can repair your constructs to their full hit points. You are always considered to have enough scrap and material to create and repair your constructs.Your constructs act on your turn, though they don't 
take actions unless you command them to. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any of your constructs within 60 feet of you, issuing a command to each one. You can decide what action the construct will take and where it will move. If you command your constructs to attack, each construct makes only one attack. Alternatively, you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If a command is too complex for a construct 
to follow, or if the construct is unable to follow it, it spends its turn motionlessly considering the command. Otherwise, once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until complete.
 The connection to your constructs is taxing, and you can't magically summon or command any other creatures while your constructs are active.
## Constructs
Name Spell Levels Wizard Level
Defense Drone 1 2nd
Mechanical Spider 1 2nd
Medical Drone 1 2nd
Recon Drone 1 2nd
Single Task Automaton 3 5th
Multi-Task Automaton 7 11th

## Assault Programming
Starting at 6th level, your constructs add your Intelligence modifier to their attack and damage rolls.
## Construct Upgrade
At 10th level, whenever you assemble a construct, you can apply one of the following upgrades to it. Each construct can have only one upgrade at a time, which you can switch when you repair it over a long rest.
- Alloy Chassis. The construct's AC is increased by 2.
- Energy Plating. The construct has resistance to one damage type of your choice.
- High-Torque Motors. The construct's speed increases by 10 feet.
