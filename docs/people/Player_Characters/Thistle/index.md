Pixie Traits
As a Pixie your character is blessed with special attributes,
that set it apart from other creatures
Age. Pixies age very slowly, if at all. They are created
fully formed, physically and mentally, taking on the
appearance of a beautiful human of the age of 10 to 30
with pointed ears.
Alignment. Pixies are as wild like the elements of
nature they were created from, but also know that nature
has rules that it follows. As such the fey are often neutral
on the lawful-chaos spectrum, tho some do go to the ends
of it sometimes. Protecting nature and its freedom is of
utmost importance to pixies, much like other fey, and they
are more often good than not.
Size. In Pixie form pixie sizes ranging from 3 to 5 inches
in sprite form. In giant form they are 12 times this size,
going from 3 to 5 inches to 3 to 5 feet tall. Your size is tiny
as a Pixies and medium as a giant.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 15 feet, and your
base flying speed is 40 feet in pixie form, 30 feet walking
and 25 flying in giant form.
Transformation. pixies have the ability to change
between their sprite and giant forms at will, with use of an
action. Both forms have their pros and cons however
Pixie form is the most well known form. Pixies have the
ability to fly and are able to dash through the air the same
as when walking in giant form. This ability makes pixies
extremely mobile, but it has its cons as well. When in Pixie
form, pixies are unable to use any attacks, or spells due to
their small size. Flying vertically counts as difficult terrain.
In giant form pixies are able to use their normal attacks
and spells as any other humanoid can, and gain a faster
walking speed.
Fey Creature. You are immune to being charmed, and
can't be put to sleep by magic. You have 60 ft Darkvision
and 60 ft Truesight
Languages. You can speak, read, and write common
and sylvan. Sylvan is an old language, being the root of
elvish. The language is most commonly known for being
used in spell incantations, and it is said that one can
become entranced by its beauty and fluidity.

Ignan
Those created from flames have explosively unstable
personalities. They are often times the most problematic,
due to their short fuses, but Ignan are highly valuable
allies. What these flaming Pixies lack in predictability, they
make up for in their ability to channel magical forces,
making them powerful sorcerers.
Ignan elemental colors are vibrant oranges and reds.
Their shimmering hair is short and forms into whispy
shimmering locks, causing it to resemble actual fire. Their
wings resemble autumn leaves, and have even length to
width proportions.
Ability Score Increase. Your charisma score is
increased by 2 and your intelligence score is increased by
1
Burning Spirit. You are resistant to fire damage.
Pyromancy. You know the Firebolt cantrip, charisma is
your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.

Exile
Sometimes seen as a fate worse than death, exile has 
long been a popular sanction for radicals, dissidents, 
and troublemakers. Exiling these people allows the 
authorities to remove a thorn from their sides without 
creating a martyr or having to keep the unwanted person 
in costly perpetual captivity. Many a coup or revolution 
has resulted in the leaders and courtiers of the old regime 
being consigned to exile, sometimes on a moon or 
neighboring planet, sometimes on the other side of the 
‘verse.
 On occasion, a person may choose exile voluntarily, 
either as an alternative to something worse or because 
they desire time on the Frontier to grow and develop. An 
exile has a unique opportunity to absorb foreign cultures 
and contact émigré communities while rallying support 
remotely. Living in exile might provide benefits that 
aren't available back home, such as the freedom to pursue 
otherwise forbidden love interests or take advantage of 
more lenient tax policies, either of which could deliver the 
impetus to accept a self-imposed exile.
 Exiles take to adventuring for a number of reasons. 
For some, their exile was only temporary, and now they 
seek to embark on a dangerous journey home, while 
others might seek to foment rebellion in absentia so as to 
be welcomed as liberating heroes on their return. Some 
exiles are gripped by wanderlust, traveling the world 
with a small group of companions. The unluckiest of all, 
however, might find themselves unwelcome everywhere, 
with no choice other than to continue wandering forever.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival
Languages: Any two of your choice
Equipment: A dagger, a small strongbox, a memento 
from your homeland, a set of common clothes, and a 
pouch containing 5 gp
Feature: Exile Network
You keep in touch with a network of exiles and 
expatriates, who possess an eclectic mix of skills and the 
durable spirit of pioneers. If you need to find someone 
with an unusual or specialized skill (such as art forgery, 
translation of ancient languages, or poison-brewing), you 
likely know where to find them.
Variant Feature: Radical Sympathizers
As a prominent figurehead for a group of religious, 
political, or ethnic radicals, you are often able to find 
people who sympathize with your situation. When you 
employ hirelings, they may offer you better rates, fanatical 
loyalty, or enhanced services.
Reason for Exile
You were exiled for a reason. Choose a ‘crime’ or roll on 
the table below to determine why you were forced to leave 
your home.
d10 Crime
1 Opposition to political rulers
2 Tax exile
3 Religious dissent/radicalism
4 Sentenced to exile for serious crime
5 Death sentence commuted to exile after 
committing capital crime
6 Forbidden love
7 Refugee displaced by war or disaster
8 Escaping shameful failures committed at home
9 Fleeing false accusations
10 Self-imposed exile/journey of self-discovery
Suggested Characteristics 
Being exiled is a deeply painful experience, and life as 
a stateless persona non grata is extremely challenging. 
Such a trial is sure to leave some marks on the exile’s 
personality.
d8 Personality Trait
1 I jump whenever anyone knocks on my door.
2 I stand by my principles, rather than compromising 
them.
3 Hand-written letters are my preferred means of 
communication.
4 I am fascinated by different cultures.
5 I sometimes become pensive and withdrawn.
6 I have a lot of interesting and unusual friends.
7 I often reminisce about my years before exile.
8 I write a lot of poetry in my spare time.
d6 Ideal
1 Homecoming. I hope to return to my homeland one 
day. (Any)
2 Liberty. I will live the way I want to! (Chaotic)
3 Peace. I will make the most of my time in exile, 
living a peaceable life. (Lawful)
4 Leadership. It is on me to lead my people through 
the wilderness. (Good)
5 Revenge. I must take revenge on those who cast me 
out! (Evil)
6 Refuge. In these dangerous times, I must focus 
solely on survival. (Neutral)
d6 Bond
1 I have made many good friends in the émigré 
community.
2 I still write to my family back home.
3 People count on me as a symbol of resistance.
4 I have started a new family in my adoptive homeland.
5 I cannot return home until I have found what I am 
looking for.
6 I am still wanted by the courts.
d6 Flaw
1 I have trouble keeping my big mouth shut, and often 
end up ranting against my opponents.
2 I get in trouble with the law wherever I go.
3 I can’t seem to put down roots or form lasting 
connections anywhere.
4 My hatred for the people who exiled me sometimes 
crowds out reason in my head.
5 I prefer to work alone, and rarely seek compromise 
with others.
6 I’ve been away so long, I have lost touch with my 
family/culture/language.


# School of Automata
Inspired by the practicality of gadgeteers, wizards in the School of Automata depart from the traditional realm of scholarly book-smart mages in favor of a hands-on, mechanical approach to their magic. These so-called mechamancers use their expertise in mechanist's tools, engineering, and the principles of magical technology to animate obedient automatons to follow their every command. Typically, mechamancers reside some distance away from the dangers of exploring, while their creations engage in the unpleasantness of combat on their behalf.
## Bonus Proficiencies
Starting when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the Technology skill and mechanist's tools. 
## Engineering Savant
Beginning at 2nd level, you can fashion and animate constructs that serve at your command. When you prepare spells following a long rest, you use your mechanist's tools and spend spell slots to raise a collection of mundane parts into mechanical constructs. Once you have expended a spell slot to make a construct, you can't regain that slot until the construct is disassembled (requiring 10 minutes of work) or drops to 0 hit points. Different constructs cost different number of spell slot levels and can only be created when you have enough levels in this class, as shown on the Constructs table above. You can expend one or more spell slots to create each construct, as long as you meet or exceed the number of slot levels required. You can have up to 3 constructs at one time.
 When you take a long rest, you can repair your constructs to their full hit points. You are always considered to have enough scrap and material to create and repair your constructs.Your constructs act on your turn, though they don't 
take actions unless you command them to. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any of your constructs within 60 feet of you, issuing a command to each one. You can decide what action the construct will take and where it will move. If you command your constructs to attack, each construct makes only one attack. Alternatively, you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If a command is too complex for a construct 
to follow, or if the construct is unable to follow it, it spends its turn motionlessly considering the command. Otherwise, once given an order, the construct continues to follow it until complete.
 The connection to your constructs is taxing, and you can't magically summon or command any other creatures while your constructs are active.
## Constructs
Name Spell Levels Wizard Level
Defense Drone 1 2nd
Mechanical Spider 1 2nd
Medical Drone 1 2nd
Recon Drone 1 2nd
Single Task Automaton 3 5th
Multi-Task Automaton 7 11th

## Assault Programming
Starting at 6th level, your constructs add your Intelligence modifier to their attack and damage rolls.
## Construct Upgrade
At 10th level, whenever you assemble a construct, you can apply one of the following upgrades to it. Each construct can have only one upgrade at a time, which you can switch when you repair it over a long rest.
- Alloy Chassis. The construct's AC is increased by 2.
- Energy Plating. The construct has resistance to one damage type of your choice.
- High-Torque Motors. The construct's speed increases by 10 feet.
## Perfected Core
By 14th level, you have perfected the construct cores that animate and control your automatons. You use your action to assume direct control of one of your constructs: when you do so, you can see through its senses, designate exactly where it will move, and choose what action it will take. While controlling a construct directly, if you command it to attack, it can make multiple attacks if it has the Multiattack trait.

Actions
Surveillance Protocol. The drone creates a holographic marker above one target it can see within 60 feet until the beginning of the drone’s next turn. For that duration, attacks against the target can’t have disadvantage (unless the disadvantage is due to the Automatic property), and the target has disadvantage on checks made to hide.

# Automatons
Automatons represent a vast array of specialized mechanized servants, imbued by their construct cores with motion and limited reason.
## Constructed Servants. 
All constructs are created to fulfill a purpose, and pose no threat unless specifically designed to do so. Certain constructs, such as golems and shield guardians, might be designed with heavy armor and weapons for combat, but the vast majority are laborers with simple and specific duties. Maw spaceports are cleaned by one type of automation and ships are 
refueled by another. By and large, constructs are abundant, obedient, and relatively inexpensive.
Automatons recognize their owners by means of a command word and regard all other creatures as neutral agents, which are either ignored or treated with hostility, depending on their commands.
## Limited Intelligence. 
With a limited memory for commands, each type of automaton must perform a specific task, and often fails if a task requires abstraction to accomplish. They find it challenging, if not outright impossible, to improvise solutions or deal with 
paradoxical instructions, so an automaton's owner should be extremely careful with their commands.The possibility for greater intelligence in an automaton is not unheard-of, it's merely a matter of sophisticated magic. The vect are demonstrable proof that truly intelligent constructs can be created, and are simultaneously the reason for the paranoia and dread surrounding the idea of sentient constructs. Many believe that it's only a matter of time before legions of worker 
constructs are awakened to revolt against their living overlords.
## Infection. 
Because of a deep flaw in the design of all construct cores, automatons are vulnerable to a constructspecific magical disease: the N-Virus. A construct infected with the N-Virus shows few signs at first, only minor malfunctions and momentary instances of faulty logic as it spreads to other machines. Soon, however, the virus shows its face, turning all infected constructs into a band of killing machines.
Instances of the N-Virus are rare, and are typically combated with machine quarantines and systematic construct decommissions. However, N-Virus constructs tend to be cleverer than their limited counterparts and have a knack for escaping to spread the virus further.
## Constructed Nature. 
An automaton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
## Mechanical Spider
Nimble scouts and couriers, mechanical spiders are an invaluable tool for mechanists and noblemen. Though simple constructs, mechanical spiders are entrusted with sensitive deliveries, as they come with a crude, yet effective, failsafe: when tampered with, mechanical spiders simply explode. The spiders lack offensive capabilities unless extensively modified and are extremely frail, but are irreplaceable to those who trust them with deliveries and confidential information.
Moreover, mechanical spiders can fold down into an extremely compact package, allowing them to be deployed from one-time use spider pods.
## Single Task Automaton
Designed with but one purpose in mind, the Single Task Automaton (STA) is the simplest and most abundant construct used for labor. This automaton is normally constructed in a cylindrical or rectangular wheeled chassis, with at least three mechanical arms bearing tools related to its purpose. A cleaning STA might have a broom and feather duster, whereas a manufacturing STA might have a screwdriver and a small welding torch.
 To operate, each of these constructs is given an explicit task, which must follow an uncomplicated algorithm with clear beginning and end conditions. Automatons don't have a true understanding of their tasks, so improperly programming them can result in dangerously aberrant behavior.
## Multi-Task Automaton
Though far from intelligent, a Multi-Task Automaton (MTA) can handle slightly more complex tasks than other constructs and is given general-purpose manipulators capable of carrying and operating a wide-variety of tools, including conventional weapons. Moreover, an MTA is bipedal, allowing it to navigate difficult terrain. Unlike an STA, an MTA can be reprogrammed with new tasks often, and, though it is still incapable of abstraction, an MTA can perform relatively complex operations. An MTA might, for example, be set up to run a small shop, programmed to take people's coats, or be tasked 
with preparing a meal.

7th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 100 miles
Components: V, S, M (a silver saucer)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell teleports a creature within range to your location. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw to resist this effect. Moreover, you must know the target's precise location when you cast this spell. If the target is more than 100 feet from its supposed location, it has advantage on its saving throw. If it is more than 500 feet away, the spell fails. On a failed save, the target is placed at a location of your choice within 30 feet of you. You choose if the target is sitting, standing, prone, or bound with nearby restraints. At the end of the spell's duration, you can choose whether the target remains at your location or is teleported back to the location from which it was abducted
Antivirus
1st-level abjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 24 hours
You ward a device that you touch from digital interlopers. For the duration, this device can't be disabled by magical effects, such as the technical difficulties or logic bomb spells, and it can’t be infected by the N-Virus. Additionally, creatures have disadvantage on Intelligence (Data) checks made to hack this device.
Arcane Anomaly
1st-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (30-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a broken mirror)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You spread cracks in the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. For the duration, whenever a spell is cast within range, roll a d6. On a 1, the spell casting fails, expending a spell slot as normal, but not consuming expensive material components. Arcane Capacitor
6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a potato)
Duration: Instantaneous
You channel a wave of arcane power into your fingertips, but recycle the leftover energy into a new spell slot. Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 force damage. Whether you hit or miss, you then regain one expended 1st-level spell slot.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th level spell slot, you instead regain an expended 2nd level spell slot. If you cast it using a 9th level spell slot, you instead regain an expended 3rd level spell slot.
Asteroid Cluster
2nd-level conjuration (mega)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 20,000 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lump of rock)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a cluster of asteroids that fills a 2,000-foot cube. Each ship and mega creature is slowed in this area; every foot of movement in that space costs one extra foot. Additionally, any mega creature or ship inside the cluster that didn't take Evasive Maneuvers takes 2d8 mega bludgeoning damage at the beginning of its turn. If an attack is made through the cluster, the target is treated as having half cover.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the size of the cube increases by 500 feet and the damage increases by 1d8 mega points for each slot level above 2nd.
Astrogation

Autopilot
1st-level enchantment (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a quartz crystal)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a spaceship, granting it a limited ability to operate without active control by its crew. For the duration, the ship can make ability checks and saving throws that would be made by its pilot, engineer, or gunner, even if there is no one in those roles.

 Additionally, when you cast this spell, you can choose a speed and direction within the ship’s cone of movement for the ship to travel when there is no creature in the Pilot role. The ship moves automatically at the beginning of the initiative order. This automatic movement ends whenever a creature enters the Pilot role.
 A ship can't be commandeered while it is under the influence of this spell.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration increases to 8 hours.

You wave your hand and conjure a sophisticated arcane weapon, constructed of brilliant compressed light, which hovers in the air in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. The weapon fires a crackling beam of energy at a target you choose within 60 feet of it, making a ranged spell attack using your spell attack bonus.

You compress waves of light into a solid, shimmering structure composed of hardlight within range. You can create a Huge or smaller object (contained within a 15-
foot cube, or 27 connected 5-foot cubes) which persists for the duration. For example, you can build a bridge crossing a chasm, a tower to see over a treeline, or a patch for the hull of a starship. This object can't have moving parts or directly harm anyone. No matter what object you build, it has AC 10 and HP equal to 30 + your spellcasting modifier. The object collapses into nothingness and the spell ends if it drops to 0 hit points.  At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, its HP increases by 10 per slot level above 3rd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can use your action to change the object created into any other object you choose which fits the criteria.

• You have advantage on Strength checks and saving throws.
• The armor confers the benefits of a life suit.
• The armor has two integrated battlefists. You have proficiency with these weapons. When you attack with them, you make a melee spell attack against a target within 10 feet of you. On a hit, the battlefists deal force damage equal to 2d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
• You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.

Intensify Gravity
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 100 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell intensifies gravity in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in this area must spend two feet of movement for every foot moved, including flying, jumping, and climbing movement. This can be combined with difficult terrain to slow movement to a quarter of normal speed. If a prone creature wishes to stand up, it must succeed on a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a failure, it can’t move at all on its turn.
 Objects in the area, including those being worn or carried, weigh double their usual weight, which may cause creatures to become encumbered or cause load-bearing spells like levitate to fail. Any ranged weapon attacks that pass into, out of, or through the area have disadvantage, and any falling damage dealt within the spell’s area is doubled.
Logic Bomb
4th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a functioning construct core)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Circuits of arcane energy reach out from your fingertips and embed themselves in nearby technology, afflicting everything they touch with a magical virus. Unattended magical technology you choose within range is disabled for the duration. Each creature you choose that is wearing or carrying magical technology (or has embedded or integrated technology on their person) must succeed an Intelligence (Technology) check against your spell save DC at the beginning of each of its turns or be unable to use this technology. On a successful check, the spell ends for this target.  Each construct you choose within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. Living constructs, such as vect, make this saving throw with advantage. On a failed save, a construct can't move and is incapacitated, even if it would otherwise be immune to being incapacitated, for the duration. At the beginning of each of its turns, an affected construct can repeat this saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Magic Mic
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
You conjure into existence a spectral microphone, which can hover in front of you or be held in one hand. Speaking through the microphone amplifies your voice to a booming level and allows you to distort your voice. This distortion can change your voice's pitch, cause an echo, make it sound metallic, add a layer of static noise, or any other simple audio effect. It can't be used to completely duplicate another person's voice. You can change the mic's volume and change the nature of the distortion on your turn (no action required). Your voice also projects through radio waves allowing you to be heard on comm sets and communication systems within 10 miles.
 You can use your action to shout into the mic. When you do so, each creature you choose within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 thunder damage.  The spell’s damage increases when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).
Mega Image
3rd-level illusion (mega)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10,000 feet
Components: V, S, M (a sheep skin)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 1,000-
foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, temperatures, and cosmic signals appropriate to the thing being depicted. You can’t, however, create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature.
 As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of an asteroid, you can make it rotate on its axis. Similarly, you can cause the image to make different sounds at different times.
 Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. The image does, however, fool sensor systems. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and the image’s other sensory qualities become faint for that creature.
Memorize 1st-level enchantment (ritual)

You create a barrage of asteroids at a point you choose within range. Mega creatures and the pilots of any ships in a 1,000-foot radius centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. If there is no creature in that role, the save automatically fails. A target takes 8d6 mega bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 mega points for each slot level above 3rd

This spell filters your presence from the minds of machines. Choose up to five willing creatures of your choice within range. These targets become silent and invisible to constructs.

3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pair of armbands)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Two muscular arms consisting of brilliant arcane energy appear on a willing creature that you touch. These arms are fully functional and can be used to hold weapons and shields (allowing the target to hold 2 two-handed weapons, or 4 one-handed weapons), perform somatic components of spells, and perform other actions, though the arms themselves don't grant the target additional actions. For the duration, the target has advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made using the additional arms. Also, if the arms are used to carry weapons, the target can use a bonus action to make an additional melee weapon attack using the arms.
Psychedelics 1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self (60-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a mushroom)

Repulsor Ring
2nd-level abjuration

You outline a 5-foot diameter circle on the ground, which is warded against intruders. Only creatures you choose can step within the circle.

Rift
2nd-level transmutation (mega)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10,000 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You tear a rift in space at a point you choose within range. The rift is composed of 10 panels, each 200 feet long, 200 feet wide, and 25 feet thick. These panels can be arranged in any pattern you desire, but each panel must touch another panel and all panels must form a single, continuous wall. You can't place a panel in a space that is occupied by a creature or object.
 The rift is impassable and blocks line of sight through it. It counts as an object with an AC of 15 and 90 mega hit points; the spell ends if the rift drops to 0 hit points.
 If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its entire duration, the rift becomes permanent, though it can still be dispelled or destroyed. Otherwise, it disappears when the spell ends.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the rift’s area expands by 5 panels for each slot level above 2nd.

Components: V, S, M (a ship’s computer or an arcane terminal)
Duration: Instantaneous
You create a comprehensive digital simulation of the next day’s events, granting you insight into a probable future. The GM offers a summary of the likely events of the next 24 hours. Because you set the simulation’s parameters based on information you know, the summary doesn’t account for unknown information (such as an ambush awaiting you, or a traitor in your midst) or unlikely events (such as the gain or loss of a companion).
Spacetime Distortion
1st-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S

You warp spacetime around a creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to resist this effect. Creatures within 5 feet of the target are treated as if they are 10 feet away, and creatures 10 feet away are treated as if they are 5 feet away. Moreover, other creatures can move through the target's space, as long as they don't end their movement there.

Creatures 5 feet away from the target are treated as if they are 60 feet away from the target, creatures 10 feet away from the target are treated as being 5 feet away, and creatures 15 feet away from the target are treated as being 10 feet away. Ranged attacks against this creature have disadvantage. Splice
7th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a special glass syringe, worth 1,000 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
With a pinprick beam of arcana, you steal a sample of genetic information from a target creature you can see within range and bestow that information upon a recipient creature you touch. The donor creature need not be alive or even whole, as long as you target part of a creature that has died within the last 10 days.  The recipient creature gains any of the following traits from the target creature that you choose: the target's movement speed and types of movement, all of the target's damage resistances, the target's special senses, or one of the target's special traits, such as a ghast's Stench trait. If selected, the GM decides which special trait, if any, the recipient gains from the target creature. The recipient doesn't gain any traits from the creature that do not result from its race or monster statistics.  The recipient's appearance changes to resemble a hybrid of the target creature and itself. These changes, as well as the traits gained by the recipient creature, last for the duration.

4th-level conjuration

Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
A Large vehicle with two wheels and holographic circuits appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. The cycle has AC 10 and 10 hit points. It roars to life when its controls are grasped. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can operate the cycle, and one creature can ride as a passenger. The cycle has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour.
 Wherever the cycle moves, it leaves behind a brightly chromatic, translucent wall of force behind it. The wall is 10 feet high and nothing can physically pass through it. It is immune to all damage, but a 20-foot long portion of it can be destroyed by a dispel magic or disintegrate spell. Portions of the wall that the rider creates by moving the cycle vanish at the end of the rider's next turn.
 The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it, if the cycle drops to 0 hit points or more points, or if the cycle collides with its walls or another substantial obstacle.

Choose a spaceship you can see within range. The target’s pilot must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the ship’s speed is halved for the duration.

Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
For the briefest possible instant, you open a portal into the Void, revealing the hideous lights beyond. Choose one creature you can see to make a Constitution saving throw. The target has advantage on this roll if it can’t see you. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 radiant damage. If you roll an 8 on any damage die, you can roll an additional d8 and add its damage to the total, rolling again if this die is also an 8, and so on. You can roll a total number of damage dice for this cantrip equal to twice the number of damage dice you initially rolled.
 This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a glass fish bowl worth 10 gp)
Duration: 1 hour
You create a spherical area of clean, breathable air centered on a point within range for the duration. The sphere can have any radius you choose to a maximum of 30 feet. If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that isn't being worn or carried, the sphere is centered on the object and moves with it.  Airborne substances such as poisonous gas, smoke, or fog can't enter the sphere, and any such substances already within the sphere's area are destroyed. If such a substance is created by a spell of a higher level than this one, it is unaffected.
 The area’s temperature is comfortable, regardless of the outside environment.
