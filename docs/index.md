        Caravan of traders enters the city of Moonbright, a community of refugees that have settled in the ruins of an ancient Elven city. Ansa traveled with the caravan in the company of Zsophia, a historian and book/map collector. Zsophia intends to set up shop in Moonbright due to the dungeon located inside of the city. She plans on mapping out the dungeon and selling information pertaining to dungeons. 

        A cart with multiple men raced into the city being chased by a massive owlbear. The owlbear was dispatched by the party while Norm ran off with the egg.

        Party goes for drinks and discuss the pending wedding between Bruk and Serra. The city gaurd report that the cart that had raced into town was found smashed against a wall and the horses were dead. The party went to investigate. After Ansa scryied for the men from the cart, Nicci conversed with a plant named "Spike". The location of the men was discovered as well as the high likelihood that the men were going to conduct an attack on the city.
