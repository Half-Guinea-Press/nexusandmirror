        We approach He That Walks Behind and we gift him a body of the barbarian. 
        In the darkness beyond the stars, He That Walks Behind encountered a little man with a shiny item and entered to peek beyond to see small people doing things.
        
        Henry, the Stag Bandit. Stag Lord works with Green Spears, but is not friendly.

        Gaea visited Ansa to discuss the perception of undead. She worked out the wild surge curse and dispelled it so that Gaea knows that his allies are living again. 
        
        Ansa has retreated to her hospital; we located an assassin bot from the Elven days.
