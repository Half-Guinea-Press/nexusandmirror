Voldun - Human - cleric
Gaea - Earth Genasi - warlock
Olympia - Ooze - rogue
Wilfiz - Gnome - artificer
Bruk (Zach) - Dwarf, son of Baronette - George the Dwarf
Thistlebloom (6’8”) - Druid of spores (mold)

The kingdom is Bravoy, our town has a river that it fishes, Bellbright. 

Investigated missing sheep and missing young man. Suspected trapper William.

William and Red Cap are friends. Chad killed William. We killed Red Cap, and took Chad back to town.

Session 1.2

Chadwick never collected his cart. “Emerald Spears” adventurer crew arrived. Looking for henchmen and guides. Came in the night before, buying up all the spirits and ale. Have map to an old ruin. 
Hugh, barkeep.

Rikoris, leader of Emerald Spears. Sent to collect family heirlooms from a distant noble family in Brayvoy. Passed empty farms on the way into town. Emerald Spears attempted to loot farms near a small hamlet.

We take the cart back to Chadwick’s farm. Rapid packed and left, including furniture, firewood, and sheep. Even all of the compost was collected from the barn. All the collected seed is removed. Evidence that Chadwick repaired the farm after we left, but didn’t go collect Chad or the cart.

We came back toward town and went to the Mitchell sheep farm. Wife heard about some issues, like a nearby farm took in a refugee girl from a farm that was attacked by goblins. They heat us up for dinner. 

We tracked the goblins back to their cave and cleared it out. The rabid boss knocked Voldun and Gaea unconscious, but not before Gaea could stabilize Voldun.

Level Up:
New Spell Comprehend Languages
Eldritch Invocations:
Mask of Many Faces
Fiendish Vigor

My Dao, during my unconsciousness, has instructed me on both appearing more strong and on surviving more damage. Thanks to their influence I shall be bigger and stronger. They were satisfied that I continued to protect my smaller friends. I have been rewarded for that bravery by learning to read or listen to any communication. Most amazing is that I can use my ring to bolster the limited healing gifts from Nesirie.
Session Three
Woke up the next morning on Mitchell's front porch. Gaea healed up with warlock pact slots.
Return to town. 
Wilfiz books the carnival for two weeks. 20s

Gaea bought a barrel of soft cider and stored it away in the Genie Vessel. Once inside, I met the Dao again face to face. He has black obsidian skin, 12 ft tall, and welcomed me to use his space.

Dile of the Thieves Guild; has a pet Crocodile.

Thistlebloom carried a chest down into the tavern. Voldune escorted Hugh out and locked the door. Olympia unlocked the chest, but Wilfiz heard a creature in the box. Thistlebloom didn’t open the box, and started to walk upstairs to investigate with Detect Magic, leaving an unlocked box on the table across from where Gaea was standing. He opened the chest with Thaumaturgy, which fell open and released a White Serpent. Voldun cleared the room with Thunderwave, before destroying all that furniture with Shatter. Wilfiz cast Grease and used the flamethrower of his cannon to ignite it. The snake died, and Gaea began cleaning up the tavern. The party looted the three rooms rented by the Emerald Spears. 

Session 1.4

Bruk was warned about our combat by village guards and he came out to personally investigate. 

Fortune Teller informs us we will travel overnight to find and save all of our townspeople. The heterochromia eyed fishmonger will tell us where to find time.

We go to the bar down by the wharf. 

Rikoras’s Journal: 8th son of a baron of The City. Started Emerald Spears. Found Emerald Spear in a Dungeon, it is sentient. Guildford Trading Company hired the ES, a shady patron, hired to collect stuff from old estate in the Ruins. Collect three chests, secured with magic. Notes of oddities: empty hamlet. 

Gaea memorizes one of the villagers that was fired.

Session 1.5

Fish Monger’s gang laid out Joey’s gang. Went well, didn’t spill out into the rest of the village. Joey’s faction is angry with Bruk and us.

Sorcerous family from City of Sigil(?): knows about portals. Explains Teleport, Teleportation Circle, Gate, doors, Well of Many Worlds, Cubic Gate. 

Day 4 of carnival, Heather’s family was found murdered, she is missing. Didn’t show up at the carnival like was expected on the first night. The murder was two days ago. Friends are three minor thugs, Joey’s turf. Human, 5’4”, brown hair, blue/green eyes. (Dead grandma’s house)

Gaea commits floating dead body to memory, is currently a very poor imitation of Heather’s boyfriend. Tattoo of crow on dead bodies, Joey’s mark, on various locations. He is carrying a greatsword disguised as a dagger.

Heather is talking through the door. She is worried about the Moon eye dwarfs, they have silver eyes. This was hinted at by the Fortune Teller. Heather opens the door and reveals her small self with blue/green eyes. Mooneyes exit the house of mirrors when people go in. 
We’re returning to the carnival, Gaea is disguised in his clerical vestments.

Session 1.6

We bust in on the fortune teller to see if she’s in on it. 

Enter the house of mirrors. Mirror Demon attacks, we kill it, it had been haunting the mirrors.

Session 1.7

Glass land: Soldiers with great swords, pikes, archers, Red Wizards (offense), Blue Wizards(Defensive), Warlock (Great Old One, He Whole Walks Behind) troops. Barracks to the right, with armories and blacksmiths. Miner housing, made of mirrors, holding families. Basic farming plots. Fairly old, up to 30 years. Ambient glow, no primary life source. Octagonal center, 2000 feet high glass ceiling. Outer wall looks into the House of Mirrors. Each wall of the octagon has a similar platform. North-most sheet has a metal wall and aperture gate shielding.

Enslaved peasants - about triple our village.
Troops - about 2000, mustering for war.
Larval Doppolgangers

Gaea escapes his cell to hang out with the Dao, who freed me from my bounds. I brought some items back to the jail and attempted to free Wilfiz with a maul. I tried three times, the first bounced off of the shackles, and the next two times I hit the tiny gnome in the head. I did heal him though.

Momom greets us from a neighboring cell. We killed two guards.

Session 1.8 

We arrive in the rebel stronghold. Momom is not well greeted. Scarda has been building this place for 40 years. Another mirror opened to someplace bad, home to eldritch horrors. Scarda has built a protective aperture gate. This is where the Doppelgangers come from. The mirror demon just kind of haunts the mirror, like Scarda had told us in the House of Mirrors. Momom is a leader of the Doppelgangers, the old ones have the gained personality. Plenty of younger Doppelgangers still function with Scarda and will try to murder Momom’s people.
Changlings are born in the mirror world of people and Dopps.

Session 2.1

Factions staying with us: Clerics and Villagers.
Weird about stolen lands: At least 3 kingdoms used to exist and have left a currency. Weird, black market entities (four armed slender men) which only trade in the old coin: Cyclops, Lizardman, Elf. Elves captured spirits for magic power, eventually larger spirits were included until doing so released hostile entities that the spirits had been holding back.


Ambient magic power from monoliths. Gemstones can collect Fey energy if properly crafted.

Fall (after Equinox) has extreme weather. Hex sides are 21 miles

A clan of Merrow raised out of a river and our casters blasted most of them with lightning. After a battle, we restrained one and Jangles used Geas to assign it to pull the Deathwagon for 30 days. Gaea healed it back to half health. 

We pull up to a wooden fort in the hills. Nici tells us it is Fort Racharo, an abandoned fort of Brevoy. About 3 days out 

Session 2.2

The party awakes to find the merrow dead, Gaea killed it on watch to release it from servitude. The river leads us to a waterfall and we discussed leaving the river by the road, but end up putting the wagon into the mirror and Gaea Fly’s down the cliff. Bruk and Voldun go over the waterfall in a barrel. Nici and the centaur sorcerer take the long way around and find an empty fort. 

We hear a scream and see a woman stuck with an arrow, with a bandit in tow. We kill the bandits and save an additional woman. The Bandits have silver pendants, wolf skulls with deer antlers. 

The two horses had Zephyr Horseshoes which we put onto our horses. The two women joined the village. We continue down the river.

Session 2.3

A T-Rex bursts out into the river and threatens us. Voldun casts a sleet storm, Bruk turned into a snake to approach it, but it bit him back to dwarf form and he washed down river. Jangle stood on a stalactite arrow and Gaea shot him to the beast. The monstrous, cursed goblin crawled around and abused the T-Rex, which caused it to change into a gigantic toad which bounded off and away.

We rode down the river to the Ruins of the ancient Elven civilization. We see the tracks of a giant bipedal bovine. Spirit orbs create a nexus or computer network, the painted runes are acting like a virus attacking that.

Session 2.4

Lake around the Elven (Pagnacost) ruins. There are mirrors that redirect light into the canyon. 
Two Hezrow demons are mid-incantation when we disrupt them. Yakphok (The Minotaurs) bound the Acayo Demons. One nearly struck down Gaea, then a poorly cast Sleep spell from the sorcerer knocked him out. Zniavolieny stepped from the ring to save Gaea from the bound demons and also offered to bring in the party, which they accepted. They have shared knowledge with the party. Obelisks  
12 Yakphok, Take over Ziggeret to Take over Elven Ruins. 

Sorcerer jumps out of the ring, polymorphed into a bird, and flew us to the Ziggurat.
All are out of the ring, after a long rest, with 30 minutes of Pass Without Trace.
+1 STR/CON, +1 AC, taller

Session 2.5

We entered a broken door around the middle of the Ziggurat and headed down in. About 5 floors down we emerge onto a 100’ square room with a large wolf-ish spirit. A raven flies over and lands on the wolf. A nine tailed fox sneaks up behind and giggles before joining the wolf - Fenris.

Elf magic has nearly drained the will out of the wolf. Its strength has been drained to power the magic. (Big brother - raven - Hugo, Little sister - fox - Kit) 
New power, Gnosis, for Necci, Voldun, Miravish, Bruk

We head up to the top in search of what the draining of the spirits might have left behind. 
When she was alone, Olympia met the demon lord and gained a boon.

We slaughtered a Blood Demon.
+2 Levels!

Session 2.6

Necci’s dream of the elven city.

We killed a Demon

Session 2.7

We settle in for a week of downtime before clearing the city. Necci continues her research. Gaea feeds the kingdom in the mornings and spends the afternoons using Cartographers Tools to translate the Raven powered scouts’ reports into an up-to-date, prepared battle map.

Hugh lets us know where Elven wine could be found. We found two Blood demons, and kill them. The sorcerer Lightning Bolts Gaea to kill the last demon. 30+ damage and Gaea loses his Hex. He is not happy, and spends the time where everyone else is investigating the alcohol resting.

Hugh has a rune flash on his forehead as he shakes Necci’s hand. She vanishes and he causes three Dao to step into the basement. The sorcerer seizes the possessed Hugh in Telekinesis, but a wild magic surge makes a Displacer Beast materialize. Voldune moves in to fight, Gaea flys down into the basement with Genie flight, and invokes Dark Obelisk.

We free Hugh, and the three Dao begin to walk away through portals. Everyone dashes in immediately, except Olympia and Gaea. Gaea is tending to Hugh and Olympia hesitates before rushing after. As she passes him, Gaea punches his ring wearing hand into her goo body and warps down into the ring.

Enter narration where the Genie reveals himself to be Gaea as the full powered Dao. He had reached out to Necci back when the Elven city was turning on the Nexus. Her three wishes were two partially disable the Nexus, knowing that Necci in the future could fix it, to wipe her memory of this to prevent the Yaks from extracting it, and to remove her to safety where she could live in the future. Gaea then moved the ring, and his imprisonment, to the coastal cave where his younger self would find it while living as a young Genasi.
