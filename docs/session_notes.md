    We take the cart back to Chadwick’s farm. Rapid packed and left, including furniture, firewood, and sheep. Even all of the compost was collected from the barn. All the collected seed is removed. Evidence that Chadwick repaired the farm after we left, but didn’t go collect Chad or the cart.
    
    We came back toward town and went to the Mitchell sheep farm. Wife heard about some issues, like a nearby farm took in a refugee girl from a farm that was attacked by goblins. They heat us up for dinner.

    My Dao, during my unconsciousness, has instructed me on both appearing more strong and on surviving more damage. Thanks to their influence I shall be bigger and stronger. They were satisfied that I continued to protect my smaller friends. I have been rewarded for that bravery by learning to read or listen to any communication. Most amazing is that I can use my ring to bolster the limited healing gifts from Nesirie.

    Thistlebloom carried a chest down into the tavern. Voldune escorted Hugh out and locked the door. Olympia unlocked the chest, but Wilfiz heard a creature in the box. Thistlebloom didn’t open the box, and started to walk upstairs to investigate with Detect Magic, leaving an unlocked box on the table across from where Gaea was standing. He opened the chest with Thaumaturgy, which fell open and released a White Serpent. Voldun cleared the room with Thunderwave, before destroying all that furniture with Shatter.

    Momom greets us from a neighboring cell. We killed two guards.

    Weird about stolen lands: At least 3 kingdoms used to exist and have left a currency. Weird, black market entities (four armed slender men) which only trade in the old coin: Cyclops, Lizardman, Elf. Elves captured spirits for magic power, eventually larger spirits were included until doing so released hostile entities that the spirits had been holding back.
    
    
    Ambient magic power from monoliths. Gemstones can collect Fey energy if properly crafted.
    
    Fall (after Equinox) has extreme weather. Hex sides are 21 miles
    
    A clan of Merrow raised out of a river and our casters blasted most of them with lightning. After a battle, we restrained one and Jangles used Geas to assign it to pull the Deathwagon for 30 days. Gaea healed it back to half health. 
    
    We pull up to a wooden fort in the hills. Nici tells us it is Fort Racharo, an abandoned fort of Brevoy. About 3 days out 
    
??? info "Session 2.2"
    
    The party awakes to find the merrow dead, Gaea killed it on watch to release it from servitude. The river leads us to a waterfall and we discussed leaving the river by the road, but end up putting the wagon into the mirror and Gaea Fly’s down the cliff. Bruk and Voldun go over the waterfall in a barrel. Nici and the centaur sorcerer take the long way around and find an empty fort. 
    
    We hear a scream and see a woman stuck with an arrow, with a bandit in tow. We kill the bandits and save an additional woman. The Bandits have silver pendants, wolf skulls with deer antlers. 
    
    The two horses had Zephyr Horseshoes which we put onto our horses. The two women joined the village. We continue down the river.
    
??? info "Session 2.3"
    
    A T-Rex bursts out into the river and threatens us. Voldun casts a sleet storm, Bruk turned into a snake to approach it, but it bit him back to dwarf form and he washed down river. Jangle stood on a stalactite arrow and Gaea shot him to the beast. The monstrous, cursed goblin crawled around and abused the T-Rex, which caused it to change into a gigantic toad which bounded off and away.
    
    We rode down the river to the Ruins of the ancient Elven civilization. We see the tracks of a giant bipedal bovine. Spirit orbs create a nexus or computer network, the painted runes are acting like a virus attacking that.
    
??? info "Session 2.4"
    
    Lake around the Elven (Pagnacost) ruins. There are mirrors that redirect light into the canyon. 
    Two Hezrow demons are mid-incantation when we disrupt them. Yakphok (The Minotaurs) bound the Acayo Demons. One nearly struck down Gaea, then a poorly cast Sleep spell from the sorcerer knocked him out. Zniavolieny stepped from the ring to save Gaea from the bound demons and also offered to bring in the party, which they accepted. They have shared knowledge with the party. Obelisks

    +1 STR/CON, +1 AC, taller
    
??? info "Session 2.5"
    
    We entered a broken door around the middle of the Ziggurat and headed down in. About 5 floors down we emerge onto a 100’ square room with a large wolf-ish spirit. A raven flies over and lands on the wolf. A nine tailed fox sneaks up behind and giggles before joining the wolf - Fenris.
    
    Elf magic has nearly drained the will out of the wolf. Its strength has been drained to power the magic. (Big brother - raven - Hugo, Little sister - fox - Kit) 
    New power, Gnosis, for Necci, Voldun, Miravish, Bruk
    d6 when making an associated skill check, able to manifest as spirit or

    We slaughtered a Blood Demon.

    Necci’s dream of the elven city.
    
    We killed a Demon
    
??? info "Session 2.7"
    
    We settle in for a week of downtime before clearing the city. Necci continues her research. Gaea feeds the kingdom in the mornings and spends the afternoons using Cartographers Tools to translate the Raven powered scouts’ reports into an up-to-date, prepared battle map.
    
    Hugh lets us know where Elven wine could be found. We found two Blood demons, and kill them. The sorcerer Lightning Bolts Gaea to kill the last demon. 30+ damage and Gaea loses his Hex. He is not happy, and spends the time where everyone else is investigating the alcohol resting.
    
    Hugh has a rune flash on his forehead as he shakes Necci’s hand. She vanishes and he causes three Dao to step into the basement. The sorcerer seizes the possessed Hugh in Telekinesis, but a wild magic surge makes a Displacer Beast materialize. Voldune moves in to fight, Gaea flys down into the basement with Genie flight, and invokes Dark Obelisk.
    
    We free Hugh, and the three Dao begin to walk away through portals. Everyone dashes in immediately, except Olympia and Gaea. Gaea is tending to Hugh and Olympia hesitates before rushing after. As she passes him, Gaea punches his ring wearing hand into her goo body and warps down into the ring.
    
    Enter narration where the Genie reveals himself to be Gaea as the full powered Dao. He had reached out to Necci back when the Elven city was turning on the Nexus. Her three wishes were two partially disable the Nexus, knowing that Necci in the future could fix it, to wipe her memory of this to prevent the Yaks from extracting it, and to remove her to safety where she could live in the future. Gaea then moved the ring, and his imprisonment, to the coastal cave where his younger self would find it while living as a young Genasi.

    Demon Bone Sarcophagus - dungeon in our city

    Ansa Notes

    ---

    Norm was reincarnated as a Firbolg. He met his god, Eric. He has dedicated himself in the service of Eric.
    
    Gaea and Ansa talked about his wild magic surge problem with viewing everyone in the party as undead. Ansa cast remove curse to fix that problem.
    
    The party discussed how to approach the Green Spears issue. The mountains are unpassible. The concept of building an airship was discussed. This would involve a lot of time and resources. Solidifying the city and establishing trade routes was discussed. There is a need to bring in more people to further establish the city. Going into the dungeon located in the city to amass more treasure to be used to bolster the economy of the city was decided upon.
    
    The dungeon is located in a bulky red vault like building in a park. The elves built the keep over the dungeon. Outside the dungeon is a cart like rolling library and a camp fire. This has been setup by Zsofia. Zsofia is a priestess of Ariadne, the goddess of dungeons. Ariadne placed the dungeons in the world as a challange. Each dungeon is associated with one of the 11 moons in the world. The dungeon refills each moon cycle of its associated moon. The dungeon in the city is called the Demon Bone Sarcophagus. The story of the dungeon is that a warrior empress of fire fought ice demons. The warrior empress was from a lost kingdom. She defeated the demons and bound them. She took those bindings to the grave. 
    
    The dungeon is located in the top left corner of the city. It is a fairly small dungeon, 2-3 floors, and is rank silver.
    
    Nici has mirror shard that acts as a key. Metal doors in teh vault have a shard lock. Many dire baboon skeletons and elven skeletons are inside the vault. 
    
    There are 2 statues, one of a feminine boy and one of a masculine girl. The masculine girl statue was smashed. After doing something to the boy statue, a dire baboon came out from behind it. Combat ensued and the party defeated the dire baboon.
    
    While in the dungeon, natural healing with hit dice doesn't work.
